Two hours? CAR. Two hours. SCENE
VII.–LÃANDRE, OCTAVE, SCAPIN. LEA. Ah! my dear Scapin, I pray you to help me. SCA. (rising and passing proudly before LÃANDRE). Ah! my
dear Scapin! I am my dear Scapin, now that I am wanted. LEA. I will forgive you all that you confessed just now, and more
also. SCA. No, no; forgive me nothing; run your sword through and through
my body. I should be perfectly satisfied if you were to kill me. LEA. I beseech you rather to give me life by serving my love. SCA. Nay, nay; better kill me. LEA. You are too dear to me for that. I beg of you to make use for me
of that wonderful genius of yours which can conquer everything. SCA. Certainly not. Kill me, I tell you. LEA. Ah! for mercy's sake, don't think of that now, but try to give
me the help I ask. OCT. Scapin, you must do something to help him. SCA. How can I after such abuse? LEA. I beseech you to forget my outburst of temper, and to make use
of your skill for me. OCT. I add my entreaties to his. SCA. I cannot forget such an insult. OCT. You must not give way to resentment, Scapin. LEA. Could you forsake me, Scapin, in this cruel extremity? SCA. To come all of a sudden and insult me like that. LEA. I was wrong, I acknowledge. SCA. To call me scoundrel, knave, infamous wretch! LEA. I am really very sorry. SCA. To wish to send your sword through my body! LEA. I ask you to forgive me, with all my heart; and if you want to
see me at your feet, I beseech you, kneeling, not to give me up. OCT. Scapin, you cannot resist that? SCA. Well, get up, and another time remember not to be so hasty. LEA. Will you try to act for me? SCA. I will see. LEA. But you know that time presses. SCA. Don't be anxious. How much is it you want? LEA. Five hundred crowns. SCA. You? OCT. Two hundred pistoles. SCA. I must extract this money from your respective fathers' pockets. (To OCTAVE) As far as yours is concerned, my plan is all ready. (To LÃANDRE) And as for yours, although he is the greatest
miser imaginable, we shall find it easier still; for you know that he is
not blessed with too much intellect, and I look upon him as a man who
will believe anything. This cannot offend you; there is not a suspicion
of a resemblance between him and you; and you know what the world
thinks, that he is your father only in name. LEA.
