We shall find a way of settling that. HYA. (to ZERBINETTE). The similarity of our fate ought to
strengthen the tie of friendship between us. We are both subject to the
same fears, both exposed to the same misfortune. ZER. You have this advantage at least that you know who your parents
are, and that, sure of their help, when you wish to make them known, you
can secure your happiness by obtaining a consent to the marriage you
have contracted. But I, on the contrary, have no such hope to fall back
upon, and the position I am in is little calculated to satisfy the
wishes of a father whose whole care is money. HYA. That is true; but you have this in your favour, that the one you
love is under no temptation of contracting another marriage. ZER. A change in a lover's heart is not what we should fear the most. We may justly rely on our own power to keep the conquest we have made;
but what I particularly dread is the power of the fathers; for we cannot
expect to see them moved by our merit. HYA.
