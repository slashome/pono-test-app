Here then. SCA. No, Sir; do not trust your money to me. I would rather you
trusted another with your message. ARG. Ah me! here, take it. SCA. No, no, I tell you; do not trust me. Who knows if I do not want
to steal your money from you? ARG. Take it, I tell you, and don't force me to ask you again. However, mind you have an acknowledgment from him. SCA. Trust me; he hasn't to do with an idiot. ARG. I will go home and wait for you. SCA. I shall be sure to go. (Alone.) That one's all right;
now for the other. Ah! here he is. They are sent one after the other to
fall into my net. SCENE
XI.–GÃRONTE, SCAPIN. SCA. (affecting not to see GÃRONTE). O Heaven! O unforeseen
misfortune! O unfortunate father! Poor GÃ©ronte, what will you do? GER. (aside). What is he saying there with that doleful
face? SCA. Can no one tell me whereto find Mr. GÃ©ronte? GER. What is the matter, Scapin? SCA. (running about on the stage, and still affecting not to see
or hear GÃRONTE). Where could I meet him, to tell him of this
misfortune? GER. (stopping SCAPIN). What is the matter? SCA. (as before). In vain I run everywhere to meet him. I
cannot find him. GER. Here I am. SCA. (as before). He must have hidden himself in some place
which nobody can guess. GER. (stopping SCAPIN again). Ho! I say, are you
blind? Can't you see me? SCA. Ah! Sir, it is impossible to find you. GER. I have been near you for the last half-hour. What is it all
about? SCA. Sir.... GER. Well! SCA. Your son, Sir.... GER. Well! My son.... SCA. Has met with the strangest misfortune you ever heard of. GER. What is it? SCA. This afternoon I found him looking very sad about something
which you had said to him, and in which you had very improperly mixed my
name. While trying: to dissipate his sorrow, we went and walked about in
the harbour. There, among other things, was to be seen a Turkish galley. A young Turk, with a gentlemanly look about him, invited us to go in,
and held out his hand to us. We went in. He was most civil to us; gave
us some lunch, with the most excellent fruit and the best wine you have
ever seen. GER. What is there so sad about all this? SCA.
