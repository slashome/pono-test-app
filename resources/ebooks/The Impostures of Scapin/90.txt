Alas! Why must the course of true love never run smooth? How
sweet it would be to love with no link wanting in those chains which
unite two hearts. SCA. How mistaken you are about this! Security in love forms a very
unpleasant calm. Constant happiness becomes wearisome. We want ups and
downs in life; and the difficulties which generally beset our path in
this world revive us, and increase our sense of pleasure. ZER. Do tell us, Scapin, all about that stratagem of yours, which, I
was told, is so very amusing; and how you managed to get some money out
of your old miser. You know that the trouble of telling me something
amusing is not lost upon me, and that I well repay those who take that
trouble by the pleasure it gives me. SCA. Silvestre here will do that as well as I. I am nursing in my
heart a certain little scheme of revenge which I mean to enjoy
thoroughly. SIL. Why do you recklessly engage in enterprises that may bring you
into trouble? SCA. I delight in dangerous enterprises. SIL. As I told you already, you would give up the idea you have if
you would listen to me. SCA. I prefer listening to myself. SIL. Why the deuce do you engage in such a business? SCA. Why the deuce do you trouble yourself about it? SIL. It is because I can see that you will without necessity bring a
storm of blows upon yourself. SCA. Ah, well, it will be on my shoulders, and not on yours. SIL. It is true that you are master of your own shoulders, and at
liberty to dispose of them as you please. SCA. Such dangers never stop me, and I hate those fearful hearts
which, by dint of thinking of what may happen, never undertake
anything. ZER. (to SCAPIN). But we shall want you. SCA. Oh, yes! but I shall soon be with you again. It shall never be
said that a man has with impunity put me into a position of betraying
myself, and of revealing secrets which it were better should not be
known. SCENE
II.–GÃRONTE, SCAPIN. GER. Well! Scapin, and how have we succeeded about my son's
mischance? SCA. Your son is safe, Sir; but you now run the greatest danger
imaginable, and I sincerely wish you were safe in your house. GER.
