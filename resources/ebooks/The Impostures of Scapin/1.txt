THE
IMPOSTURES OF SCAPIN. (LES
FOURBERIES DE SCAPIN.)

By MoliÃ¨re

Translated Into English Prose. With Short Introductions And
Explanatory Notes By Charles Heron Wall

Acted on May 24, 1671, at the Palais Royal, 'Les Fourberies de
Scapin' had great success. It is nothing, however, but a farce, taken
partly from classical, partly from Italian or from French sources. MoliÃ¨re acted the part of Scapin. CONTENTS
