OCT. One day, as I was going with him to the people who have charge
of the girl with whom he is in love, we heard in a small house on a
by-street, lamentations mixed with a good deal of sobbing. We inquired
what it was, and were told by a woman that we might see there a most
piteous sight, in the persons of two strangers, and that unless we were
quite insensible to pity, we should be sure to be touched with it. SCA.
