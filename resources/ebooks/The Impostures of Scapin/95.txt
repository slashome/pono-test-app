Ah! Scapin, show yourself a devoted servant. Do not forsake me,
I pray you. SCA. I will do what I can. I feel for you a tenderness which renders
it impossible for me to leave you without help. GER. Be sure that I will reward you for it, Scapin, and I promise you

help. GER. A very good idea. SCA. The best possible. You will see.
