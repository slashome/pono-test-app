How! It was on mine he laid his stick. SCA. I beg your pardon, Sir, it was on my back. GER. What do you mean? I am sure I felt the blows, and feel them
still. SCA. No, I tell you; it was only the end of his stick that reached
your shoulders. GER. You should have gone a little farther back, then, to spare me,
and.... SCA. (pushing GÃRONTE'S head back into the sack). Take care, here is another man who looks like a foreigner. "Frient, me
run like one Dutchman, and me not fint all de tay dis treatful GÃ©ronte."
Hide yourself well. "Tell me, you, Sir gentleman, if you please, know
you not vere is dis GÃ©ronte, vat me look for?" No, Sir, I do not know
where GÃ©ronte is. "Tell me, trutful, me not vant much vit him. Only to
gife him one tosen plows vid a stick, and two or tree runs vid a swort
tro' his shest." I assure you, Sir, I do not know where he is. "It seems
me I see sometink shake in dat sack." Excuse me, Sir. "I pe shure dere
is sometink or oder in dat sack." Not at all, Sir. "Me should like to
gife one plow of de swort in dat sack." Ah! Sir, beware, pray you, of
doing so. "Put, show me ten vat to be dere?" Gently, Sir. "Why chently?"
You have nothing to do with what I am carrying. "And I, put I vill see."
You shall not see. "Ah! vat trifling." It is some clothes of mine. "Show
me tem, I tell you." I will not. "You vill not?" No. "I make you feel
this shtick upon de sholders." I don't care. "Ah! you vill poast!"
(Striking the sack, and calling out as if he were beaten) Oh! oh!
