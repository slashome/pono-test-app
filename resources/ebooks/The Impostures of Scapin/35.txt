You take my words too much like a philosopher. I mean to
say that he was fatally engaged in this affair. ARG. And why did he engage in it? SCA. Do you expect him to be as wise as you are? Can you put an old
head on young shoulders, and expect young people to have all the
prudence necessary to do nothing but what is reasonable? Just look at
our LÃ©andre, who, in spite of all my lessons, has done even worse than
that. I should like to know whether you yourself were not young once,
and have not played as many pranks as others? I have heard say that you
were a sad fellow in your time, that you played the gallant among the
most gallant of those days, and that you never gave in until you had
gained your point. ARG. It is true, I grant it; but I always confined myself to
gallantry, and never went so far as to do what he has done. SCA. But what was he to do? He sees a young person who wishes him
well; for he inherits it from you that all women love him. He thinks her
charming, goes to see her, makes love to her, sighs as lovers sigh, and
does the passionate swain. She yields to his pressing visits; he pushes
his fortune. But her relations catch him with her, and oblige him to
marry her by main force. SIL.
