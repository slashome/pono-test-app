Yes; but what you do not know.... OCT. I know all I care to know. ARG. I mean to say that the daughter of Mr. GÃ©ronte.... OCT. The daughter of Mr. GÃ©ronte will never be anything to me. GER. It is she who.... OCT. (to GÃRONTE). You need not go on, Sir; I hope you will
forgive me, but I shall abide by my resolution. SIL. (to OCTAVE). Listen.... OCT. Be silent; I will listen to nothing. ARG. (to OCTAVE). Your wife.... OCT. No, father, I would rather die than lose my dear Hyacintha
(crossing the theatre, and placing himself by HYACINTHA). Yes,
all you would do is useless; this is the one to whom my heart is
engaged. I will have no other wife. ARG. Well! she it is whom we give you. What a madcap you are never to
listen to anything but your own foolish whim. HYA. (showing GÃRONTE). Yes, Octave, this is my father whom
I have found again, and all our troubles are over. GER. Let us go home; we shall talk more comfortably at home. HYA. (showing ZERBINETTE). Ah! father, I beg of you the
favour not to part me from this charming young lady. She has noble
qualities, which will be sure to make you like her when you know
her. GER. What! do you wish me to take to my house a girl with whom your
brother is in love, and who told me to my face so many insulting
things? ZER. Pray forgive me, Sir; I should not have spoken in that way if I
had known who you were, and I only knew you by reputation. GER. By reputation; what do you mean? HYA. Father, I can answer for it that she is most virtuous, and that
the love my brother has for her is pure. GER. It is all very well. You would try now to persuade me to marry
my son to her, a stranger, a street-girl! SCENE

NÃRINE, SILVESTRE. LEA. My father, you must no longer say that I love a stranger without
birth or wealth. Those from whom I bought her have just told me that she
belongs to an honest family in this town. They stole her away when she
was four years old, and here is a bracelet which they gave me, and which
will help me to discover her family. ARG. Ah! To judge by this bracelet, this is my daughter whom I lost
when she was four years old. GER. Your daughter? ARG. Yes, I see she is my daughter. I know all her features again. My
dear child! GER. Oh! what wonderful events! SCENE
XIII.–ARGANTE, GÃRONTE, LÃANDRE, OCTAVE, HYACINTHA,

ZERBINETTE, NÃRINE, SILVESTRE, CARLE. CAR. Ah! gentlemen, a most sad accident has just taken place. GER. What is it?
