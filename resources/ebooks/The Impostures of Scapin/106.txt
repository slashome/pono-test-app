Mr. Argante, you see me in the greatest trouble. ARG. And I am in the greatest sorrow. GER. This rascal, Scapin, has got five hundred crowns out of me. ARG. Yes, and this same rascal, Scapin, two hundred pistoles out of
me. GER. He was not satisfied with getting those five hundred crowns, but
treated me besides in a manner I am ashamed to speak of. But he–shall
pay me for it. ARG. I shall have him punished for the trick he has played me. GER. And I mean to make an example of him. SIL. (aside). May Heaven grant that I do not catch my share
of all this! GER. But, Mr. Argante, this is not all; and misfortunes, as you know,
never come alone. I was looking forward to the happiness of to-day
seeing my daughter, who was everything to me; and I have just heard that
she left Tarentum a long while since; and there is every reason to
suppose that the ship was wrecked, and that she is lost to me for
ever. ARG. But why did you keep her in Tarentum, instead of enjoying the
happiness of having her with you? GER. I had my reasons for it; some family interests forced me till
now to keep my second marriage secret. But what do I see? SCENE
VIII.–ARGANTE, GÃRONTE, NÃRINE, SILVESTRE. GER. What! you here, NÃ©rine? NER. (on her knees before GÃRONTE). Ah! Mr. Pandolphe,
how.... GER. Call me GÃ©ronte, and do not use the other name any more. The
reasons which forced me to take it at Tarentum exist no longer. NER.
