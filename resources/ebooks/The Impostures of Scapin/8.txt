Ah! Scapin, if you could find some scheme, invent some plot, to
get me out of the trouble I am in, I should think myself indebted to you
for more than life. SCA. To tell you the truth, there are few things impossible to me
when I once set about them. Heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough
share of genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother
wit, for all those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and
vulgar give the name of impostures; and I can boast, without vanity,
that there have been very few men more skilful than I in expedients and
intrigues, and who have acquired a greater reputation in the noble
profession. But, to tell the truth, merit is too ill rewarded nowadays,
and I have given up everything of the kind since the trouble I had
through a certain affair which happened to me. OCT.
