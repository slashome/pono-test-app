GER. (looking out of the sack). Ah! all my bones are
broken. SCA. Ah! I am dying. GER. Why the deuce do they strike on my back? (As he is going to strike, GÃRONTE gets out of the bag,
and SCAPIN runs away.)

GER. (alone). Ah! infamous wretch! ah I rascal! ah! scoundrel! It is thus that you murder me? SCENE
III.–ZERBINETTE, GÃRONTE. ZER. (laughing, without seeing GÃRONTE). Ah, ah! I must
really come and breathe a little. GER. (aside, not seeing ZERBINETTE). Ah! I will make you pay
for it. ZER. (not seeing GÃRONTE). Ah, ah, ah, ah! What an amusing
story! What a good dupe that old man is! GER. This is no matter for laughter; and you have no business to
laugh at it. ZER. Why? What do you mean, Sir? GER. I mean to say that you ought not to laugh at me. ZER. Laugh at you? GER. Yes. ZER. How! Who is thinking of laughing at you? GER. Why do you come and laugh in my face? ZER. This has nothing to do with you. I am only laughing with myself
at the remembrance of a story which has just been told me. The most
amusing story in the world. I don't know if it is because I am
interested in the matter, but I never heard anything so absurd as the
trick that has just been played by a son to his father to get some money
out of him. GER. By a son to his father to get some money out of him? ZER. Yes; and if you are at all desirous of hearing how it was done,
I will tell you the whole affair. I have a natural longing for imparting
to others the funny things I know. GER. Pray, tell me that story. ZER. Willingly. I shall not risk much by telling it you, for it is an
adventure which is not likely to remain secret long. Fate placed me
among one of those bands of people who are called gypsies, and who,
tramping from province to province, tell you your fortune, and do many
other things besides. When we came to this town, I met a young man, who,
on seeing me, fell in love with me. From that moment he followed me
everywhere; and, like all young men, he imagined that he had but to
speak and things would go on as he liked; but he met with a pride which
forced him to think twice. He spoke of his love to the people in whose
power I was, and found them ready to give me up for a certain sum of
money. But the sad part of the business was that my lover found himself
exactly in the same condition as most young men of good family, that is,
without any money at all. His father, although rich, is the veriest old
skinflint and greatest miser you ever heard of. Wait a moment–what is
his name? I don't remember it–can't you help me? Can't you name some one
in this town who is known to be the most hard-fisted old miser in the
place? GER.
