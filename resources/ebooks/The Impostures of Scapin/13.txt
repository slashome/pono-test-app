OCT. As we are great friends, he told me at once of his love, and
took me to see this young girl, whom I thought good-looking, it is true,
but not so beautiful as he would have had me believe. He never spoke of
anything but her; at every opportunity he exaggerated her grace and her
beauty, extolled her intelligence, spoke to me with transport of the
charms of her conversation, and related to me her most insignificant
saying, which he always wanted me to think the cleverest thing in the
world. He often found fault with me for not thinking as highly as he
imagined I ought to do of the things he related to me, and blamed me
again and again for being so insensible to the power of love. SCA.
