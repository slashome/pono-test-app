No. ZER. There is in his name some Ron...Ronte... Or...Oronte...No. GÃ©...GÃ©ronte. Yes, GÃ©ronte, that's my miser's name. I have it now; it is
the old churl I mean. Well, to come back to our story. Our people wished
to leave this town to-day, and my lover would have lost me through his
lack of money if, in order to wrench some out of his father, he had not
made use of a clever servant he has. As for that servant's name, I
remember it very well. His name is Scapin. He is a most wonderful man,
and deserves the highest praise. GER. (aside). Ah, the wretch! ZER. But just listen to the plan he adopted to take in his dupe–ah! ah! ah! ah! I can't think of it without laughing heartily–ah! ah! ah! He
went to that old screw–ah! ah! ah!–and told him that while he was
walking about the harbour with his son–ah! ah!–they noticed a Turkish
galley; that a young Turk had invited them to come in and see it; that
he had given them some lunch–ah! ah!–and that, while they were at table,
the galley had gone into the open sea; that the Turk had sent him alone
back, with the express order to say to him that, unless he sent him five
hundred crowns, he would take his son to be a slave in Algiers–ah, ah,
ah! You may imagine our miser, our stingy old curmudgeon, in the
greatest anguish, struggling between his love for his son and his love
for his money. Those five hundred crowns that are asked of him are five
hundred dagger-thrusts–ah! ah! ah! ah! He can't bring his mind to tear
out, as it were, this sum from his heart, and his anguish makes him
think of the most ridiculous means to find money for his son's
ransom–ah! ah! ah! He wants to send the police into the open sea after
the Turk's galley–ah! ah! ah! He asks his servant to take the place of
his son till he has found the money to pay for him–money he has no
intention of giving–ah! ah! ah! He yields up, to make the five hundred
crowns, three or four old suits which are not worth thirty–ah! ah! ah! The servant shows him each time how absurd is what he proposes, and each
reflection of the old fellow is accompanied by an agonising, "But what
the deuce did he want to go in that galley for? Ah! cursed galley. Ah! scoundrel of a Turk!" At last, after many hesitations, after having
sighed and groaned for a long time...But it seems to me that my story
does not make you laugh; what do you say to it? GER. What I say? That the young man is a scoundrel–a good-for-nothing
fellow–who will be punished by his father for the trick he has played
him; that the gypsy girl is a bold, impudent hussy to come and insult a
man of honour, who will give her what she deserves for coming here to
debauch the sons of good families; and that the servant is an infamous
wretch, whom GÃ©ronte will take care to have hung before to-morrow is
over. SCENE
IV.–ZERBINETTE, SILVESTRE. SIL. Where are you running away to? Do you know that the man you were
speaking to is your lover's father? ZER. I have just begun to suspect that it was so; and I related to
him his own story without knowing who he was. SIL. What do you mean by his story? ZER. Yes; I was so full of that story that I longed to tell it to
somebody. But what does it matter?
