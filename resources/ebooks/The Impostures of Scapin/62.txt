I think I have found something that will answer much better. The
sorrow that I felt for you made me rummage in my head to find some means
of getting you out of trouble; for I cannot bear to see kind fathers a
prey to grief without feeling sad about it, and, besides, I have at all
times had the greatest regard for you. ARG. I am much obliged to you. SCA. Then you must know that I went to the brother of the young girl
whom your son has married. He is one of those fire-eaters, one of those
men all sword-thrusts, who speak of nothing but fighting, and who think
no more of killing a man than of swallowing a glass of wine. I got him
to speak of this marriage; I showed him how easy it would be to have it
broken off, because of the violence used towards your son. I spoke to
him of your prerogatives as father, and of the weight which your rights,
your money, and your friends would have with justice. I managed him so
that at last he lent a ready ear to the propositions I made to him of
arranging the matter amicably for a sum of money. In short, he will give
his consent to the marriage being cancelled, provided you pay him
well. ARG. And how much did he ask? SCA. Oh! at first things utterly out of the question. ARG.
