In all good faith, Mr. Argante, shall I tell you what? The
education of children is a thing that one could never be too careful
about. ARG. You are right; but why do you say that? GER. Because most of the follies of young men come from the way they
have been brought up by their fathers. ARG. It is so sometimes, certainly; but what do you mean by saying
that to me? GER. Why do I say that to you? ARG. Yes. GER. Because, if, like a courageous father, you had corrected your
son when he was young, he would not have played you such a trick. ARG. I see. So that you have corrected your own much better? GER. Certainly; and I should be very sorry if he had done anything at
all like what yours has done. ARG. And if that son, so well brought up, had done worse even than
mine, what would you say? GER.
