(aside). May be. ARG. (thinking himself alone). All they can say will be
useless. SCA. We shall see. ARG. (thinking himself alone). They will not take me in. SCA. (aside). I don't know that. ARG. (thinking himself alone). I shall know how to put my
rascal of a son in a safe place. SCA. (aside). We shall see about that. ARG. (thinking himself alone). And as for that rascal
Silvestre, I will cudgel him soundly. SIL. (to SCAPIN). I should have been very much astonished if
he had forgotten me. ARG. (seeing SILVESTRE). Ah, ah! here you are, most wise
governor of a family, fine director of young people! SCA. Sir, I am delighted to see you back. ARG. Good morning, Scapin. (To SILVESTRE) You have really
followed my orders in a fine manner, and my son has behaved
splendidly. SCA. You are quite well, I see. ARG. Pretty well. (To SILVESTRE) You don't say a word, you
rascal! SCA. Have you had a pleasant journey? ARG. Yes, yes, very good. Leave me alone a little to scold this
villain! SCA. You want to scold? ARG. Yes, I wish to scold. SCA. But whom, Sir? ARG. (Pointing to SILVESTRE). This scoundrel! SCA. Why?
