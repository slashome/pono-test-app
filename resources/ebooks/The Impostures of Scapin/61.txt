What was it? SCA. That if the father of a family has been away from home for ever
so short a time, he ought to dwell upon all the sad news that may greet
him on his return. He ought to fancy his house burnt down, his money
stolen, his wife dead, his son married, his daughter ruined; and be very
thankful for whatever falls short of all this. In my small way of
philosophy, I have ever taken this lesson to heart; and I never come
home but I expect to have to bear with the anger of my masters, their
scoldings, insults, kicks, blows, and horse-whipping. And I always thank
my destiny for whatever I do not receive. ARG. That's all very well; but this rash marriage is more than I can
put up with, and it forces me to break off the match I had intended for
my son. I have come from my solicitor's to see if we can cancel it. SCA. Well, Sir, if you will take my advice, you will look to some
other way of settling this business. You know what a law-suit means in
this country, and you'll find yourself in the midst of a strange bush of
thorns. ARG. I am fully aware that you are quite right; but what else can I
do? SCA.
