What is it? What trouble are you in? You are all upset, I see. OCT. Ah! my dear Scapin, I am in despair; I am lost; I am the most
unfortunate of mortals. SCA. How is that? OCT. Don't you know anything of what has happened to me? SCA. No. OCT. My father is just returning with Mr. GÃ©ronte, and they want to
marry me. SCA. Well, what is there so dreadful about that? OCT. Alas! you don't know what cause I have to be anxious. SCA. No; but it only depends on you that I should soon know; and I am
a man of consolation, a man who can interest himself in the troubles of
young people. OCT.
