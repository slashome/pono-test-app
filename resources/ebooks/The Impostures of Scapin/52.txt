Sir. OCT. (keeping back LÃANDRE). For mercy's sake! LEA. (trying to strike). Leave me to wreak my anger upon
him. OCT. In the name of our friendship, LÃ©andre, do not strike him. SCA. What have I done to you, Sir? LEA. What you have done, you scoundrel! OCT. (still keeping back LÃANDRE). Gently, gently. LEA. No, Octave, I will have him confess here on the spot the perfidy
of which he is guilty. Yes, scoundrel, I know the trick you have played
me; I have just been told of it. You did not think the secret would be
revealed to me, did you? But I will have you confess it with your own
lips, or I will run you through and through with my sword. SCA. Ah! Sir, could you really be so cruel as that? LEA. Speak, I say. SCA. I have done something against you, Sir? LEA. Yes, scoundrel! and your conscience must tell you only too well
what it is. SCA. I assure you that I do not know what you mean. LEA. (going towards SCAPIN to strike him). You do
not know? OCT. (keeping back LÃANDRE). LÃ©andre! SCA. Well, Sir, since you will have it, I confess that I drank with
some of my friends that small cask of Spanish wine you received as a
present some days ago, and that it was I who made that opening in the
cask, and spilled some water on the ground round it, to make you believe
that all the wine had leaked out. LEA. What! scoundrel, it was you who drank my Spanish wine, and who
suffered me to scold the servant so much, because I thought it was she
who had played me that trick? SCA. Yes, Sir; I am very sorry, Sir. LEA. I am glad to know this. But this is not what I am about now. SCA. It is not that, Sir? LEA. No; it is something else, for which I care much more, and I will
have you tell it me. SCA. I do not remember, Sir, that I ever did anything else. LEA. (trying to strike SCAPIN). Will you speak? SCA. Ah! OCT. (keeping back LÃANDRE). Gently. SCA. Yes, Sir; it is true that three weeks ago, when you sent me in
the evening to take a small watch to the gypsy {Footnote:
Ãgyptienne. Compare act v. scene ii. BohÃ©mienne is a
more usual name.} girl you love, and I came back, my clothes spattered
with mud and my face covered with blood, I told you that I had been
attacked by robbers who had beaten me soundly and had stolen the watch
from me. It is true that I told a lie. It was I who kept the watch,
Sir. LEA. It was you who stole the watch? SCA. Yes, Sir, in order to know the time. LEA.
