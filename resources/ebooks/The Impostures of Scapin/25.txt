OCT. After a few words, with which I tried to soothe her grief, we
left her; and when I asked LÃ©andre what he thought of her, he answered
coldly that she was rather pretty! I was wounded to find how unfeelingly
he spoke to me of her, and I would not tell him the effect her beauty
had had on my heart. SIL. (to OCTAVE). If you do not abridge your story, we shall
have to stop here till to-morrow. Leave it to me to finish it in a few
words. (To SCAPIN) His heart takes fire from that moment. He
cannot live without going to comfort the amiable and sorrowful girl. His
frequent visits are forbidden by the servant, who has become her
guardian by the death of the mother. Our young man is in despair; he
presses, begs, beseeches–all in vain. He is told that the young girl,
although without friends and without fortune, is of an honourable
family, and that, unless he marries her, he must cease his visits. His
love increases with the difficulties. He racks his brains; debates,
reasons, ponders, and makes up his mind. And, to cut a long story short,
he has been married these three days. SCA.
