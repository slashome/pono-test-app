GER. What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for? Ah! cursed
galley! Scoundrel of a Turk! May the devil take you! SCAPIN (alone). He can't get over the five hundred crowns I
wrench from him; but he has not yet done with me, and I will make him
pay in a different money his imposture about me to his son. SCENE
XII.-OCTAVE, LÃANDRE, SCAPIN. OCT. Well, Scapin, have your plans been successful? LEA. Have you done anything towards alleviating my sorrow? SCA. (to OCTAVE). Here are two hundred pistoles I have got
from your father. OCT. Ah! how happy you make me. SCA. (to LÃANDRE), But I could do nothing for you. LEA. (going away). Then I must die, Sir, for I could not
live without Zerbinette. SCA. Hallo! stop, stop; my goodness, how quick you are! LEA. What can become of me? SCA. There, there, I have all you want. LEA. Ah! you bring me back to life again. SCA. But I give it you only on one condition, which is that you will
allow me to revenge myself a little on your father for the trick he has
played me. LEA. You may do as you please. SCA. You promise it to me before witnesses? LEA.
