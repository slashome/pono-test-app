Ah! Sir, what are you talking about, and what a resolution you
are going to take. Just cast a glance on the ins and outs of justice,
look at the number of appeals, of stages of jurisdiction; how many
embarrassing procedures; how many ravening wolves through whose claws
you will have to pass; serjeants, solicitors, counsel, registrars,
substitutes, recorders, judges and their clerks. There is not one of
these who, for the merest trifle, couldn't knock over the best case in
the world. A serjeant will issue false writs without your knowing
anything of it. Your solicitor will act in concert with your adversary,
and sell you for ready money. Your counsel, bribed in the same way, will
be nowhere to be found when your case comes on, or else will bring
forward arguments which are the merest shooting in the air, and will
never come to the point. The registrar will issue writs and decrees
against you for contumacy. The recorder's clerk will make away with some
of your papers, or the instructing officer himself will not say what he
has seen, and when, by dint of the wariest possible precautions, you
have escaped all these traps, you will be amazed that your judges have
been set against you either by bigots or by the women they love. Ah! Sir, save yourself from such a hell, if you can. 'Tis damnation in this
world to have to go to law; and the mere thought of a lawsuit is quite
enough to drive me to the other end of the world. ARG. How much does he want for the mule? SCA. For the mule, for his horse and that of his servant, for the
harness and pistols, and to pay a little something he owes at the hotel,
he asks altogether two hundred pistoles, Sir. ARG. Two hundred pistoles? SCA. Yes. ARG. (walking about angrily). No, no; we will go to law. SCA. Recollect what you are doing. ARG. I shall go to law. SCA. Don't go and expose yourself to.... ARG. I will go to law. SCA. But to go to law you need money. You must have money for the
summons, you must have money for the rolls, for prosecution, attorney's
introduction, solicitor's advice, evidence, and his days in court. You
must have money for the consultations and pleadings of the counsel, for
the right of withdrawing the briefs, and for engrossed copies of the
documents. You must have money for the reports of the substitutes, for
the court fees {1} at the conclusion, for registrar's enrolment, drawing
up of deeds, sentences, decrees, rolls, signings, and clerks'
despatches; letting alone all the presents you will have to make. Give
this money to the man, and there you are well out of the whole
thing. {1} Ãpices, "spices," in ancient times, equalled
sweetmeats, and were given to the judge by the side which
gained the suit, as a mark of gratitude. These Ã©pices had long
been changed into a compulsory payment of money when MoliÃ¨re wrote. In
Racine's Plaideurs, act ii. scene vii., Petit Jean takes
literally the demand of the judge for Ã©pices, and fetches the
pepper-box to satisfy him. ARG. Two hundred pistoles! SCA. Yes, and you will save by it. I have made a small calculation in
my head of all that justice costs, and I find that by giving two hundred
pistoles to your man you will have a large margin left–say, at least a
hundred and fifty pistoles–without taking into consideration the cares,
troubles, and anxieties, which you will spare yourself. For were it only
to avoid being before everybody the butt of some facetious counsel, I
had rather give three hundred pistoles than go to law. {Footnote: What
would MoliÃ¨re have said if he had been living now!}

ARG. I don't care for that, and I challenge all the lawyers to say
anything against me. SCA. You will do as you please, but in your place I would avoid a
lawsuit. ARG. I will never give two hundred pistoles. SCA. Ah!
