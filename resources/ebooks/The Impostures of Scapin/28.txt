And, above all, add also the poverty of my beloved, and the
impossibility there is for me to do anything for her relief. SCA. Is that all? You are both of you at a great loss about nothing. Is there any reason to be alarmed? Are you not ashamed, you, Silvestre,
to fall short in such a small matter? Deuce take it all! You, big and
stout as father and mother put together, you can't find any expedient in
your noddle? you can't plan any stratagem, invent any gallant intrigue
to put matters straight? Fie! Plague on the booby! I wish I had had the
two old fellows to bamboozle in former times; I should not have thought
much of it; and I was no bigger than that, when I had given a hundred
delicate proofs of my skill. SIL. I acknowledge that Heaven has not given me your talent, and that
I have not the brains like you to embroil myself with justice. OCT. Here is my lovely Hyacintha! SCENE
III.–HYACINTHA, OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE. HYA. Ah! Octave, is what Silvestre has just told NÃ©rine really true? Is your father back, and is he bent upon marrying you? OCT. Yes, it is so, dear Hyacintha; and these tidings have given me a
cruel shock. But what do I see? You are weeping? Why those tears? Do you
suspect me of unfaithfulness, and have you no assurance of the love I
feel for you? HYA. Yes, Octave, I am sure that you love me now; but can I be sure
that you will love me always? OCT. Ah! could anyone love you once without loving you for ever? HYA. I have heard say, Octave, that your sex does not love so long as
ours, and that the ardour men show is a fire which dies out as easily as
it is kindled. OCT. Then, my dear Hyacintha, my heart is not like that of other men,
and I feel certain that I shall love you till I die. HYA. I want to believe what you say, and I have no doubt that you are
sincere; but I fear a power which will oppose in your heart the tender
feelings you have for me. You depend on a father who would marry you to
another, and I am sure it would kill me if such a thing happened. OCT. No, lovely Hyacintha, there is no father who can force me to
break my faith to you, and I could resolve to leave my country, and even
to die, rather than be separated from you. Without having seen her, I
have already conceived a horrible aversion to her whom they want me to
marry; and although I am not cruel, I wish the sea would swallow her up,
or drive her hence forever. Do not weep, then, dear Hyacintha, for your
tears kill me, and I cannot see them without feeling pierced to the
heart. HYA. Since you wish it, I will dry my tears, and I will wait without
fear for what Heaven shall decide. OCT. Heaven will be favourable to us. HYA. It cannot be against us if you are faithful. OCT. I certainly shall be so. HYA. Then I shall be happy. SCA. (aside). She is not so bad, after all, and I think her
pretty enough. OCT. (showing SCAPIN). Here is a man who, if he would, could
be of the greatest help to us in all our trouble. SCA. I have sworn with many oaths never more to meddle with anything. But if you both entreat me very much, I might.... OCT. Ah! if entreaties will obtain your help, I beseech you with all
my heart to steer our bark. SCA. (to HYACINTHA). And you, have you anything to say? HYA. Like him, I beseech you, by all that is most dear to you upon
earth, to assist us in our love. SCA. I must have a little humanity, and give way. There, don't be
afraid; I will do all I can for you. OCT. Be sure that.... SCA. (to OCTAVE). Hush! (To HYACINTHA) Go, and make
yourself easy. SCENE
IV.–OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE. SCA. (to OCTAVE). You must prepare yourself to receive your
father with firmness. OCT. I confess that this meeting frightens me before hand, for with
him I have a natural shyness that I cannot conquer. SCA. Yes; you must be firm from the first, for fear that he should
take advantage of your weakness, and lead you like a child. Now, come,
try to school yourself into some amount of firmness, and be ready to
answer boldly all he can say to you. OCT. I will do the best I can. SCA. Well! let us try a little, just to see. Rehearse your part, and
let us see how you will manage. Come, a look of decision, your head
erect, a bold face. OCT. Like this. SCA. A little more. OCT. So? SCA. That will do. Now, fancy that I am your father, just arrived;
answer me boldly as if it were he himself.–"What! you scoundrel, you
good-for-nothing fellow, you infamous rascal, unworthy son of such a
father as I, dare you appear before me after what you have done, and
after the infamous trick you have played me during my absence? Is this,
you rascal, the reward of all my care? Is this the fruit of all my
devotion? Is this the respect due to me? Is this the respect you retain
for me?"–Now then, now then.–"You are insolent enough, scoundrel, to go
and engage yourself without the consent of your father, and contract a
clandestine marriage! Answer me, you villain! Answer me. Let me hear
your fine reasons"....–Why, the deuce, you seem quite lost. OCT. It is because I imagine I hear my father speaking. SCA. Why, yes; and it is for this reason that you must try not to
look like an idiot. OCT. I will be more resolute, and will answer more firmly. SCA. Quite sure? SIL. Here is your father coming. OCT. Oh heavens!
