ARG. To marry without his father's consent! SCA. Yes, there is something to be said against it, but my opinion is
that you should make no fuss about it. ARG. This is your opinion, but not mine; and I will make as much fuss
as I please. What! do you not think that I have every reason to be
angry? SCA. Quite so. I was angry myself when I first heard it; and I so far
felt interested in your behalf that I rated your son well. Just ask him
the fine sermons I gave him, and how I lectured him about the little
respect he showed his father, whose very footsteps he ought to kiss. You
could not yourself talk better to him. But what of that? I submitted to
reason, and considered that, after all, he had done nothing so
dreadful. ARG. What are you telling me? He has done nothing so dreadful? When
he goes and marries straight off a perfect stranger? SCA. What can one do? he was urged to it by his destiny. ARG. Oh, oh! You give me there a fine reason. One has nothing better
to do now than to commit the greatest crime imaginable–to cheat, steal,
and murder–and give for an excuse that we were urged to it by
destiny. SCA. Ah me!
