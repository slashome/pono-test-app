Yes. SCA. There, take these five hundred crowns. LEA. Ah! I will go at once and buy her whom I adore. ACT
III. SCENE
I.â€“ZERBINETTE, HYACINTHA, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE. SIL. Yes; your lovers have decided that you should be together, and
we are acting according to their orders. HYA. (to ZERBINETTE). Such an order has nothing in it but
what is pleasant to me. I receive such a companion with joy, and it will
not be my fault if the friendship which exists between those we love
does not exist also between us two. ZER. I accept the offer, and I am not one to draw back when
friendship is asked of me. SCA. And when it is love that is asked of you? ZER. Ah! love is a different thing. One runs more risk, and I feel
less determined. SCA. You are determined enough against my master, and yet what he has
just done for you ought to give you confidence enough to respond to his
love as you should. ZER. As yet I only half trust him, and what he has just done is not
sufficient to reassure me. I am of a happy disposition, and am very fond
of fun, it is true. But though I laugh, I am serious about many things;
and your master will find himself deceived if he thinks that it is
sufficient for him to have bought me, for me to be altogether his. He
will have to give something else besides money, and for me to answer to
his love as he wishes me, he must give me his word, with an
accompaniment of certain little ceremonies which are thought
indispensable. SCA. It is so he understands this matter. He only wants you as his
wife, and I am not a man to have mixed in this business if he had meant
anything else. ZER. I believe it since you say so; but I foresee certain
difficulties with the father. SCA.
