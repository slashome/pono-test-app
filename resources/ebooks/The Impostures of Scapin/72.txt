S'death! s'blood! If I can but find him, I'll make mince-meat of
him, were I to be broken alive on the wheel afterwards. (ARGANTE hides, trembling, behind SCAPIN.)

SCA. Sir, the father of Octave is a brave man, and perhaps he will
not be afraid of you. SIL. Ah! will he not? S'blood! s'death! If he were here, I would in a
moment run my sword through his body. (Seeing ARGANTE.) Who is
that man? SCA. He's not the man, Sir; he's not the man. SIL. Is he one of his friends? SCA. No, Sir; on the contrary, he's his greatest enemy. SIL. His greatest enemy? SCA. Yes. SIL. Ah! zounds! I am delighted at it. (To ARGANTE) You are
an enemy of that scoundrel Argante, are you? SCA. Yes, yes; I assure you that it is so. SIL. (shaking ARGANTE'S hand roughly). Shake hands,
shake hands. I give you my word, I swear upon my honour, by the sword I
wear, by all the oaths I can take, that, before the day is over, I shall
have delivered you of that rascally knave, of that scoundrel Argante. Trust me. SCA. But, Sir, violent deeds are not allowed in this country. SIL. I don't care, and I have nothing to lose. SCA. He will certainly take his precautions; he has relations,
friends, servants, who will take his part against you. SIL.
