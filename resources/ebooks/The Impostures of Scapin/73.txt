Blood and thunder! It is all I ask, all I ask. (Drawing his
sword.) Ah! s'death! ah! s'blood! Why can I not meet him at this
very moment, with all these relations and friends of his? If he would
only appear before me, surrounded by a score of them! Why do they not
fall upon me, arms in hand? (Standing upon his guard.) What! you villains! you dare to attack me? Now, s'death! Kill and slay! (He lunges out on all sides; as if he were fighting many people at
once.) No quarter; lay on. Thrust. Firm. Again. Eye and foot. Ah! knaves! ah! rascals! ah! you shall have a taste of it. I'll give you
your fill. Come on, you rabble! come on. That's what you want, you
there. You shall have your fill of it, I say. Stick to it, you brutes;
stick to it. Now, then, parry; now, then, you. (Turning towards
ARGANTE and SCAPIN.) Parry this; parry. You draw back? Stand firm, man! S'death! What! Never flinch, I say. SCA. Sir, we have nothing to do with it. SIL. That will teach you to trifle with me. SCENE
X.â€“ARGANTE, SCAPIN. SCA. Well, Sir, you see how many people are killed for two hundred
pistoles. Now I wish you a good morning. ARG. (all trembling). Scapin. SCA. What do you say? ARG. I will give the two hundred pistoles. SCA. I am very glad of it, for your sake. ARG. Let us go to him; I have them with me. SCA. Better give them to me. You must not, for your honour, appear in
this business, now that you have passed for another; and, besides, I
should be afraid that he would ask you for more, if he knew who you
are. ARG. True; still I should be glad to see to whom I give my money. SCA. Do you mistrust me then? ARG.
