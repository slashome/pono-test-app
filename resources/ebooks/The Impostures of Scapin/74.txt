Oh no; but.... SCA. Zounds! Sir; either I am a thief or an honest man; one or the
other. Do you think I would deceive you, and that in all this I have any
other interest at heart than yours and that of my master, whom you want
to take into your family? If I have not all your confidence, I will have
no more to do with all this, and you can look out for somebody else to
get you out of the mess. ARG.
