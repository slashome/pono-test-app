surely! What had been a blur of blackness had
now a visible form. A faint bark on a far hillside might mean a coming or a going Fox. Josh waited five minutes, then again he squeaked on his bare hand. The
effect was a surprise when from the shelter of the stable wall ten feet
below there leaped the great dark Fox. At fifteen feet it paused. Those
yellow orbs were fiery in the light and the rifle sights with the specks
of fire were lined. There was a sharp report and the black-robed fur was
still and limp in the snow. Who can tell the crack of a small rifle among the louder cracks of
green logs splitting with the fierce frost of a Yellowstone winter's
night? Why should travel-worn, storm-worn travellers wake at
each slight, usual sound? Who knows?
