They would have
to go a long way before they would find another bedroom so warm and
safe. Even if they go as far as the equator, with its warmth and its

The Well-meaning Skunk

I have a profound admiration for the Skunk. Indeed, I once maintained
that this animal was the proper emblem of America. It is, first of all,
peculiar to this continent. It has stars on its head and stripes on its
body. It is an ideal citizen; minds its own business, harms no one, and
is habitually inoffensive, as long as it is left alone; but it will face
any one or any number when aroused.
