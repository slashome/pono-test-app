I began to talk to him. "Now what did I
catch you for?" His only reply was a wobble of his nose, so I continued:
"I didn't know when I began, but I know now. I want to get your
picture." And again the nose wobbled. I could not take it then as my camera had gone on with my horse. I
had nothing to put the Rabbit in. I could not put it in my pocket as
that would mean crushing it in some early tumble; I needed both my hands
to climb with and catch my horse, so for lack of a better place I took
off my hat and said, "Bunny, how would you like to ride in that?" He
wobbled his nose, which I understood to mean that he didn't care. So I
put the Rabbit on my head, and put the hat on again. Then I went forward and found that the cook had recovered his pots
and pans; all was well now and my horse was awaiting me. I rode all the rest of that day with the Rabbit quietly nestling in
my hair. It was a long, hard day, for we continued till nightfall and
then made a dark camp in a thick pine woods. It was impossible to make
pictures then, so I put the little Rabbit under a leatheroid telescope
lid, on a hard level
place, gave him food and water, and left him for use in the morning. THE RABBIT
DANCE

About nine o'clock that night we were sitting about the fire, when
from the near woods was heard a tremendous "tap-tap-taptrrr,"
so loud and so near that we all jumped and stared into the darkness. Again it came, "tap-tap-tap trrrrr," a regular drum tattoo. "What is that?" we all exclaimed, and at that moment a large Rabbit
darted across the open space lighted by the fire. Again the tattoo and another Rabbit dashed across. Then it dawned on
me that that was the young Rabbit signalling to his friends. He was
using the side of his box for a drum. Again the little prisoner rolled his signal call, and then a third
Snowshoe Rabbit appeared. "Look at all the Rabbits!" exclaimed my friend. "Where is my
gun?"

"No," I said, "you don't need your gun. Wait and see.
