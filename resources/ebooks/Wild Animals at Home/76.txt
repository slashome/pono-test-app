how clever they
are at eluding us. If you turn out the biggest Lynx on the smoothest prairie you ever
saw, he will efface himself before you count twenty. The grass may be
but three inches high and the Lynx twenty-three, but he will melt into
it, and wholly escape the searching eyes of the keenest. One would not
think an empty skin could lie more flat. Add to this the
silent sinuosity of his glide; he seems to ooze around the bumps and
stumps, and bottle up his frightful energy for the final fearsome leap. His whole makeup is sacrificed to efficiency in that leap; on that
depends his life; his very existence turns on the wondrous perfection of
the sneak, of which the leap is the culmination. Hunters in all parts
where these creatures abound, agree in calling Wildcat, Lynx, and Cougar
by the undignified but descriptive name of Sneak-cat. THE BOBCAT
OR MOUNTAIN WILDCAT

The Wildcat of Europe, and of literature, is a creature of almost
unparalleled ferocity. Our own Wildcat is three times as big and heavy,
so many persons assume that it is three times as ferocious, and
therefore to be dreaded almost like a Tiger. The fact is, the American
Wildcat or Bobcat is a very shy creature, ready to run from a very small
dog, never facing a man and rarely killing anything bigger than a
Rabbit. I never saw but one Bobcat in the Yellowstone Park, and that was not
in the Park, but at Gardiner where it was held a captive. But it came
from the Park, and the guides tell me that the species is quite common
in some localities. It is readily recognized by its cat-like form and its short or
bob-tail, whence its name. XXXVI. (a) Tracks of Deer escaping and (b) Tracks of Mountain Lion in pursuit
