That vicious little can was ripped open. It was completely
filled now with the swollen toes. The surgeon dressed the wounds, and
the Grizzly was set free. His first blind animal impulse was to attack
his seeming tormenters, but they were wise and the ponies were
bear-broken; they easily avoided the charge, and he hastened to the
woods to recover, finally, both his health and his good temper, and
continue about the Park, the only full-grown Grizzly Bear, probably,
that man ever captured to help in time of trouble, and then set loose
again to live his life in peace. XLV.
