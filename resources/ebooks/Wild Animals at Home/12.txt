Last September I even heard it
back of the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, and I must say I have learned to
love it. It is a wild, thrilling, beautiful song. Our first camp was at
Yancey's last summer and just after we had all turned in, the Coyote
chorus began, a couple of hundred yards from the camp. My wife sat up
and exclaimed, "Isn't it glorious? now I know we are truly back in the
West."

The Park authorities are making great efforts to reduce the number of
Coyotes because of their destructiveness to the young game, but an
animal that is endowed with extraordinary wits, phenomenal speed,
unexcelled hardihood, and marvellous fecundity, is not easily downed. I
must confess that if by any means they should succeed in exterminating
the Coyote in the West, I should feel that I had lost something of very
great value. I never fail to get that joyful thrill when the "Medicine
Dogs" sing their "Medicine Song" in
the dusk, or the equally weird and thrilling chorus with which they
greet the dawn; for they have a large repertoire and a remarkable
register. The Coyote is indeed the Patti of the Plains. THE
COYOTE'S SONG[A]

I am the Coyote that sings each night at dark;

It was by gobbling prairie-dogs that I got such
a bark. At least a thousand prairie-dogs I fattened on,
you see,

And every bark they had in them is reproduced
in me. Refrain:

I can sing to thrill your soul or pierce it like a
lance,

And all I ask of you to do is give me half a
chance. With a yap–yap–yap for the morning

And a yoop–yoop–yoop for the night

And a yow–wow–wow for the rising moon

And a yah-h-h-h for the campfire light. Yap–yoop–yow–yahhh! I gathered from the howling winds, the frogs and
crickets too,

And so from each availing fount, my inspiration
drew. I warbled till the little birds would quit
their native bush. And squat around me on the ground in
reverential hush. Refrain:

I'm a baritone, soprano, and a bass and tenor,
too. I can thrill and slur and frill and whirr and
shake you through and through. I'm a Jews' harp–I'm an organ–I'm a fiddle and
a flute. Every kind of touching sound is found in the
coyoot. Refrain:

I'm a whooping howling wilderness, a sort of
Malibran. With Lind, Labache and Melba mixed and all
combined in one. I'm a grand cathedral organ and a calliope
sharp,

I'm a gushing, trembling nightingale, a vast
Ãolian harp. Refrain:

I can raise the dead or paint the town, or pierce you
like a lance

And all I ask of you to do is to give me half a
chance. Etc., etc., etc. (Encore verses)

Although I am a miracle, I'm not yet recognized. Oh, when the world does waken up how highly
I'll be prized. Then managers and vocal stars–and emperors
effete

Shall fling their crowns, their money bags,
their persons, at my feet. Refrain:

I'm the voice of all the Wildest West, the Patti of the
Plains;

I'm a wild Wagnerian opera of diabolic
strains;

I'm a roaring, ranting orchestra with lunatics
be-crammed;

I'm a vocalized tornado–I'm the shrieking of
the damned. Refrain:

MERRY
YEK-YEK AND HIS LIFE OF TROUBLES

The common Prairie-dog is typical of the West, more so than the
Buffalo is, and its numbers, even now, rival those of the Buffalo in its
palmiest days. I never feel that I am truly back on the open range till
I hear their call and see the Prairie-dogs once more upon their mounds. As you travel up the Yellowstone Valley from Livingstone to Gardiner you
may note in abundance this "dunce of the plains." The "dog-towns" are
frequent along the railway, and at each of the many burrows you see from
one to six of the inmates. As you come near Gardiner there is a steady
rise of the country, and somewhere near the edge of the Park the
elevation is such that it imposes one of those mysterious barriers to
animal extension which seem to be as impassable as they are invisible. The Prairie-dog range ends near the Park gates. General George S. Anderson tells me, however, that individuals are occasionally found on
the flats along the Gardiner River, but always near the gate, and never
elsewhere in the Park. On this basis, then, the Prairie-dog is entered
as a Park animal. It is, of course, a kind of Ground-squirrel. The absurd name "dog"
having been given on account of its "bark." This call is a high-pitched
"yek-yek-yek-yeeh," uttered as an alarm cry while the creature sits up
on the mound by its den, and every time it "yeks" it jerks up its tail. Old timers will tell you that the Prairie-dog's voice is tied to its
tail, and prove it by pointing out that one is never raised without the
other. As we have seen, the Coyote looks on the dog-town much as a cow does
on a field of turnips or alfalfa–a very proper place, to seek for
wholesome, if commonplace, sustenance. But Coyotes are not the only
troubles in the life of Yek-yek. Ancient books and interesting guides will regale the traveller with
most acceptable stories about the Prairie-dog, Rattlesnake, and the
Burrowing Owl, all living in the same den on a basis of brotherly love
and Christian charity; having effected, it would seem, a limited
partnership and a most satisfactory division of labour: the Prairie-dog
is to dig the hole, the Owl to mount sentry and give
warning of all danger, and the Rattler is to be ready to die at his post
as defender of the Prairie-dog's young. This is pleasing if true. There can be no doubt that at times all three live in the same
burrow, and in dens that the hard-working rodent first made. But the
simple fact is that the Owl and the Snake merely use the holes abandoned
(perhaps under pressure) by the Prairie-dog; and if any two of the three
underground worthies happen to meet in the same hole, the fittest
survives. I suspect further that the young of each kind are fair game
and acceptable, dainty diet to each of the other two. Farmers consider Prairie-dogs a great nuisance; the damage they do to
crops is estimated at millions per annum. The best way to get rid of
them, practically the only way, is by putting poison down each and every
hole in the town, which medieval Italian mode has become the accepted
method in the West. Poor helpless little Yek-yek, he has no friends; his enemies and his
list of burdens increase. The prey of everything that preys, he yet
seems incapable of any measure of retaliation. The only visible joy in
his life is his daily hasty meal of unsucculent grass, gathered between
cautious looks around for any new approaching trouble, and broken by so
many dodges down the narrow hole that his ears are worn off close to his
head. Could any simpler, smaller pleasure than his be discovered? Yet he
is fat and merry; undoubtedly he enjoys his every day on earth, and is
as unwilling as any of us to end the tale. We can explain him only if we
credit him with a philosophic power to discover happiness within in
spite of all the cold unfriendly world about him. THE
WHISTLER IN THE ROCKS

When the far-off squirrel ancestor of Yek-yek took to the plains for
a range, another of the family selected the rocky hills. He developed bigger claws for the harder digging, redder colour for
the red-orange surroundings, and a far louder and longer cry for
signalling across the peaks and canyons, and so became the bigger,
handsomer, more important creature we call the Mountain Whistler, Yellow
Marmot or Orange Woodchuck. In all of the rugged mountain parts of the Yellowstone one may hear
his peculiar, shrill whistle, especially in the warm mornings. You carefully locate the direction of the note and proceed to climb
toward it. You may have an hour's hard work before you sight the
orange-breasted
Whistler among the tumbled mass of rocks that surround his home, for it
is a far-reaching sound, heard half a mile away at times. Those who know the Groundhog of the East would recognize in the Rock
Woodchuck its Western cousin, a little bigger, yellower, and brighter in
its colours, living in the rocks and blessed with a whistle that would
fill a small boy with envy. Now, lest the critical should object to the
combination name of "Rock Woodchuck," it is well to remind them that
"Woodchuck" has nothing to do with either "wood" or "chucking," but is
our corrupted form of an Indian name "Ot-choeck," which is sometimes
written also "We-jack."

In the ridge of broken rocks just back of Yancey's is a colony of the
Whistlers; and there as I sat sketching one day, with my camera at hand,
one poked his head up near me and gave me the pose that is seen in the
photograph. THE
PACK-RAT AND HIS MUSEUM

Among my school fellows was a boy named Waddy who had a mania for
collecting odds, ends, curios, bits of brass or china, shiny things,
pebbles, fungus, old prints, bones, business cards, carved peach stones,
twisted roots, distorted marbles, or freak buttons. Anything odd or
glittering was his especial joy. He had no theory about these things. He did not do anything in
particular with them. He found gratification in spreading them out to
gloat over, but I think his chief joy was in the collecting. And when
some comrade was found possessed of a novelty that stirred his cupidity,
the pleasure of planning a campaign to secure possession, the working
out of the details, and the glory of success, were more to Waddy than
any other form of riches or exploit. The Pack-rat is the Waddy of the mountains, or Waddy was the Pack-rat
of the school. Imagine, if you would picture the Pack-rat, a small
creature like a common rat, but with soft fur, a bushy tail, and soulful
eyes, living the life of an ordinary rat in the woods, except that it
has an extraordinary mania for collecting curios. There can be little doubt that this began in the nest-building idea,
and then, because it was necessary to protect his home, cactus leaves
and thorny branches were piled on it. The instinct grew until to-day the
nest of a Pack-rat is a mass of rubbish from one to four feet high, and
four to eight feet across. I have examined many of these collections.
