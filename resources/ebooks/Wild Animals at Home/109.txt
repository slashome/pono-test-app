S. Anderson tells me that in the early '90's he took
the skin of one from a poacher. Wolverine (Gulo luscus)

Of general distribution, but not common. Northern Skunk (Mephitis hudsonica)

Rare, but found at Mammoth Hot Springs and Yancey's. Badger (Taxidea taxus)

Common. Raccoon or Coon (Procyon lotor)

Said to occur. Fifteen years ago at Gardiner I was shown one that was
said to have been taken in the Park, but it was not certain. Grizzly Bear (Ursus horribilis)

Common. The official count gives 50 in 1912. Blackbear (Ursus americanus)

Abundant and increasing. The official count gives 100 in 1912. Common or Masked Shrew (Sorex personatus)

Never taken, but included because its known range surrounds the
Park. Marsh Shrew or Water Shrew (Neosorex palustris)

Probably occurs there, since its known range surrounds the Park. Long-eared Bat (Corynorhinus macrotis pallescens)

A few were seen in the Devil's Kitchen, Mammoth Hot Springs, and one
sent to the Biological Survey for identification. This is the only Bat
taken, but the following are likely to be found, as their known range
surrounds the Park:

Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus)

Silver-haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans)

Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus)

Great Hoary Bat (Nycteris cinereus)

"Yellow-Jackets!")

(might otherwise make it too
conspicuous.)

them)

196: Changed go to to:

timber)
