Away went the Blacktail, bounding, bounding at that famous beautiful,
birdlike, soaring pace, mother and young tapping the ground and sailing
to land, and tap and sail again. And away went the greyhounds, low
coursing, outstretched, bounding like bolts from a crossbow, curving but
little and dropping only to be shot again. They were straining hard; the
Blacktail seemed to be going more easily, far more beautifully. But
alas! they were losing time. The greyhounds were closing; in
vain we yelled at them. We spurred our horses, hoping to cut them off,
hoping to stop the ugly, lawless tragedy. But the greyhounds were
frantic now. The distance between Bran and the hindmost fawn was not
forty feet. Then Eaton drew his revolver and fired shots over the
greyhounds' heads, hoping to scare them into submission, but they seemed
to draw fresh stimulus from each report, and yelped and bounded faster. A little more and the end would be.
