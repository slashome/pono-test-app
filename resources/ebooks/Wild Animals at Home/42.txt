Hofer. Miles away to the southeast we
saw some white specks showing, flashing and disappearing. Then as far to
the northeasterly we saw others. Hofer now remarked, "Two bunches of
Antelope." Then later there were flashes between and we knew
that these two bands had come together. How? When you have a chance in a zoo or elsewhere to watch Antelope at
short range you will see the cause of these flashes. By means of a
circular muscle on each buttock they can erect the white hair of the
rump patch into a large, flat,
snow-white disc which shines in the sun, and shows afar as a bright
white spot. XX.
