Bats in the Devil's Kitchen

It is unfortunate that the average person has a deep prejudice
against the Bat. Without looking or thinking for himself, he accepts a
lot of absurd tales about the winged one, and passes them on and on,
never caring for the injustice he does or the pleasure he loses. I have
loved the Bat ever since I came to know him; that is, all my mature
life. He is the climax of creation in many things, highly developed in
brain, marvellously keen in senses, clad in exquisite fur and equipped,
above all, with the crowning glory of flight. He is the prototype and
the realization of the Fairy of the Wood we loved so much as children,
and so hated to be robbed of by grown-ups, who should have known
better. I would give a good deal to have a Bat colony where I could see it
daily, and would go a long way to meet some new kind of Bat. I never took much interest in caverns, or geysers, or in any of the
abominable cavities of the earth that nature so plainly meant to keep
hidden from our eyes.
