The Rabbits and their Habits

If the Wolf may be justly proud of his jaws and the Antelope of his
legs, I am sure that the Rabbit should very properly glory in his
matchless fecundity. To perfect this power he has consecrated all the
splendid energies of his vigorous frame, and he has magnified his
specialty into a success that is worth more to his race than could be
any other single gift. Rabbits are without weapons of defense, and are simple-minded to the
last degree. Most are incapable of long-distance speed, but all have an
exuberance of multiplication that fills their ranks as fast as foe can
thin the line. If, indeed, they did not have several families, several
times a year, they would have died out several epochs back. There are three marked types of Rabbits in the Rockies–the
Cottontail, the Snowshoe, and the Jackrabbit. All of them are
represented on the
Yellowstone, besides the little Coney of the rocks which is a remote
second cousin of the family. MOLLY

Molly Freezing

Molly Freezing

I have often had occasion to comment on the "freezing" of animals. When they are suddenly aware of a near enemy or confronted by unexpected
situations, their habit is to freeze–that is, become perfectly
rigid, and remain so until the danger is past or at least
comprehended. Molly Cottontail is one of the best "freezers." Whenever she does not
know what to do, she does nothing, obeying the old Western rule, "Never
rush when you are rattled." Now Molly is a very nervous creature. Any
loud, sharp noise is liable to upset her, and feeling herself unnerved
she is very apt to stop and simply "freeze." Keep this in mind when next
you meet a Cottontail, and get a photograph. In July, 1902, I tried it myself.
