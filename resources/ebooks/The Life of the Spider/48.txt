She never strikes except when sure of her stroke. She achieves
this by means of her tower. Hiding behind the wall, she sees the
stranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he
comes within reach. These abrupt tactics make the thing a certainty. Though he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who approaches
the ambush is lost. This presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's
part; for the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims. At
best, the ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt
some weary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place. But, if the quarry do
not come to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later,
for the Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always
able to regulate their leaps. Some day or other, chance is bound to
bring one of them within the purlieus of the burrow. This is the moment
to spring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts. Until then, we maintain a
stoical vigilance.
