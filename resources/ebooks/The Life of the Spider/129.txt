Victory, after hanging for a moment in the balance, is
once again decided in the stranger's favour. The vanquished party, this
time a sister, is eaten without the slightest scruple. Her web becomes
the property of the victor. There it is, in all its horror, the right of might: to eat one's like
and take away their goods.
