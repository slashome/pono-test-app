no strife between them, no encroaching on the neighbour's property. Each
of them weaves herself a rudimentary web, as far from the rest as

laying-time arrives. The cords by which the different establishments are
hung interlace and criss-cross in a confused network. When one of them
shakes, all the others are more or less affected. This is enough to
distract the layer from her business and to make her do silly things.
