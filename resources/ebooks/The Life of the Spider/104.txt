My stratagem succeeds. As long as the parcel is stationary, the
Spider is not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw,
she runs up eagerly. There are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,
without further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the
usual game. They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,
following the rule of the preliminary poisoning. Then and then only the
mistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come
back, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the cumbersome
object out of the web. There are also clever ones. Like the others, these hasten to the
red-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come
from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the
web; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon
perceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend
their silk on useless bonds. My quivering bait does not deceive them. It
is flung out after a brief inspection. Still, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a
distance, from their leafy ambush. How do they know?
