Then,
suddenly, with her eight legs wide-spread, she lets herself drop
straight down, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets. Just
as the rope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking
backwards, so does the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling. It is extracted by the weight of her body. The descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of
gravity would give it, if uncontrolled. It is governed by the action of
the spinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them
entirely, at the faller's pleasure. And so, with gentle moderation she
pays out this living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me
the plumb, but not always the line. The great squab seems at such times
to be sprawling in space, without the least support. She comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel
ceases working. The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has
just obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning. But, this
time, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread
is extracted in another manner. The two hind-legs, with a quick
alternate action, draw it from the wallet and let it go. On returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more,
the Spider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and
floating loosely in a current of air. She fixes her end where it suits
her and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its
loop to the adjacent twigs. The desired result may be very slow in coming.
