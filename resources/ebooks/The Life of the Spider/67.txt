Cold air enters from without through the door; warm air
escapes from the room through the window. This is the drought that
carries the threads with it and enables the Spiders to embark upon their
journey. I get rid of it by closing both apertures and I break off any
communication by passing my ruler between the window and the table. Henceforth, in the motionless atmosphere, there are no departures. The
current of air is missing, the skeins are not unwound and migration
becomes impossible. It is soon resumed, but in a direction whereof I never dreamt. The
hot sun is beating on a certain part of the floor. At this spot, which
is warmer than the rest, a column of lighter, ascending air is
generated. If this column catch the threads, my Spiders ought to rise to
the ceiling of the room. The curious ascent does, in fact, take place.
