From
the convex surface of the pocket hang long chaplets of grains of sand
strung together with slender silken cords. To these sandy stalactites,
which form a bushy beard, are added a few heavy lumps hung separately
and lower down, at the end of a thread. The whole is a piece of
ballast-work, an apparatus for ensuring equilibrium and tension. The present edifice, hastily constructed in the space of a night, is
the frail rough sketch of what the home will afterwards become. Successive layers will be added to it; and the partition-wall will grow
into a thick blanket capable of partly retaining, by its own weight, the
requisite curve and capacity. The Spider now abandons the stalactites of
sand, which were used to keep the original pocket stretched, and
confines herself to dumping down on her abode any more or less heavy
object, mainly corpses of insects, because she need not look for these
and finds them ready to hand after each meal. They are weights, not
trophies; they take the place of materials that must otherwise be
collected from a distance and hoisted to the top. In this way, a
breastwork is obtained that strengthens and steadies the house. Additional equilibrium is often supplied by tiny shells and other
objects hanging a long way down. What would happen if one robbed an old dwelling, long since
completed, of its outer covering? In case of such a disaster, would the
Spider go back to the sandy stalactites, as a ready means of restoring
stability? This is easily ascertained.
