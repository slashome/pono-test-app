That is quite enough. The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten
to the central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to
the Locust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would
treat a live prey captured under normal conditions. It took the shaking
of the web to decide them to attack. Perhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous
to attract attention by itself. Then let us try red, the brightest
colour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'. None of the game
hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle out
of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust. I glue it to the web.
