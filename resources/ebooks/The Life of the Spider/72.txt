Let us wish them a prosperous journey. The problem of dissemination is now solved. What would happen if
matters, instead of being brought about by my wiles, took place in the
open fields? The answer is obvious. The young Spiders, born acrobats and
rope-walkers, climb to the top of a branch so as to find sufficient
space below them to unfurl their apparatus. Here, each draws from her
rope-factory a thread which she abandons to the eddies of the air. Gently raised by the currents that ascend from the ground warmed by the
sun, this thread wafts upwards, floats, undulates, makes for its point
of contact. At last, it breaks and vanishes in the distance, carrying
the spinstress hanging to it. The Epeira with the three white crosses, the Spider who has supplied
us with these first data concerning the process of dissemination, is
endowed with a moderate maternal industry. As a receptacle for the eggs,
she weaves a mere pill of silk. Her work is modest indeed beside the
Banded Epeira's balloons. I looked to these to supply me with fuller
documents. I had laid up a store by rearing some mothers during the
autumn. So that nothing of importance might escape me, I divided my
stock of balloons, most of which were woven before my eyes, into two
sections. One half remained in my study, under a wire-gauze cover, with,
small bunches of brushwood as supports; the other half were experiencing
the vicissitudes of open-air life on the rosemaries in the
enclosure. These preparations, which promised so well, did not provide me with
the sight which I expected, namely, a magnificent exodus, worthy of the
tabernacle occupied. However, a few results, not devoid of interest, are
to be noted.
