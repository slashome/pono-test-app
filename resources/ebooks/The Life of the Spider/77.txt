A very small part of the family are expelled with the flow of tawny
floss; the vast majority remain in the bag, which is ripped open, but
still bulges with eiderdown. Now that the breach is made, any one can go
out who pleases, in his own good time, without hurrying. Besides, a
solemn action has to be performed before the emigration. The animal must
cast its skin; and the moult is an event that does not fall on the same
date for all. The evacuation of the place, therefore, lasts several
days. It is effected in small squads, as the slough is flung aside. Those who sally forth climb up the neighbouring twigs and there, in
the full heat of the sun, proceed with the work of dissemination. The
method is the same as that which we saw in the case of the Cross Spider. The spinnerets abandon to the breeze a thread that floats, breaks and
flies away, carrying the rope-maker with it. The number of starters on
any one morning is so small as to rob the spectacle of the greater part
of its interest. The scene lacks animation because of the absence of a
crowd. To my intense disappointment, the Silky Epeira does not either
indulge in a tumultuous and dashing exodus. Let me remind you of her
handiwork, the handsomest of the maternal wallets, next to the Banded
Epeira's. It is an obtuse conoid, closed with a star-shaped disk. It is
made of a stouter and especially a thicker material than the Banded
Epeira's balloon, for which reason a spontaneous rupture becomes more
necessary than ever. This rupture is effected at the sides of the bag, not far from the
edge of the lid. Like the ripping of the balloon, it requires the rough
aid of the heat of July. Its mechanism also seems to work by the
expansion of the heated air, for we again see a partial emission of the
silky floss that fills the pouch. The exit of the family is performed in a single group and, this time,
before the moult, perhaps for lack of the space necessary for the
delicate casting of the skin. The conical bag falls far short of the
balloon in size; those packed within would sprain their legs in
extracting them from their sheaths. The family, therefore, emerges in a
body and settles on a sprig hard by. This is a temporary camping-ground, where, spinning in unison, the
youngsters soon weave an open-work tent, the abode of a week, or
thereabouts. The moult is effected in this lounge of intersecting
threads. The sloughed skins form a heap at the bottom of the dwelling;
on the trapezes above, the flaylings take exercise and gain strength and
vigour. Finally, when maturity is attained, they set out, now these, now
those, little by little and always cautiously. There are no audacious
flights on the thready airship; the journey is accomplished by modest
stages. Hanging to her thread, the Spider lets herself drop straight down, to
a depth of nine or ten inches. A breath of air sets her swinging like a
pendulum, sometimes drives her against a neighbouring branch. This is a
step towards the dispersal. At the point reached, there is a fresh fall,
followed by a fresh pendulous swing that lands her a little farther
afield. Thus, in short tacks, for the thread is never very long, does
the Spiderling go about, seeing the country, until she comes to a place
that suits her. Should the wind blow at all hard, the voyage is cut
short: the cable of the pendulum breaks and the beastie is carried for
some distance on its cord. To sum up, although, on the whole, the tactics of the exodus remain
much the same, the two spinstresses of my region best-versed in the art
of weaving mothers' wallets failed to come up to my expectations. I went
to the trouble of rearing them, with disappointing results. Where shall
I find again the wonderful spectacle which the Cross Spider offered me
by chance? I shall find it–in an even more striking fashion–among
humbler Spiders, whom I had neglected to observe. CHAPTER
VIII: THE CRAB SPIDER

The Spider that showed me the exodus in all its magnificence is known
officially as Thomisus onustus, WALCK. Though the name suggest
nothing to the reader's mind, it has the advantage, at any rate, of
hurting neither the throat nor the ear, as is too often the case with
scientific nomenclature, which sounds more like sneezing than articulate
speech. Since it is the rule to dignify plants and animals with a Latin
label, let us at least respect the euphony of the classics and refrain
from harsh splutters which spit out a name instead of pronouncing
it. What will posterity do in face of the rising tide of a barbarous
vocabulary which, under the pretence of progress, stifles real
knowledge? It will relegate the whole business to the quagmire of
oblivion. But what will never disappear is the popular name, which
sounds well, is picturesque and conveys some sort of information. Such
is the term Crab Spider, applied by the ancients to the group to which
the Thomisus belongs, a pretty accurate term, for, in this case, there
is an evident analogy between the Spider and the Crustacean. Like the Crab, the Thomisus walks sideways; she also has forelegs
stronger than her hind-legs. The only thing wanting to complete the
resemblance is the front pair of stone gauntlets, raised in the attitude
of self-defence. The Spider with the Crab-like figure does not know how to manufacture
nets for catching game. Without springs or snares, she lies in ambush,
among the flowers, and awaits the arrival of the quarry, which she kills
by administering a scientific stab in the neck. The Thomisus, in
particular, the subject of this chapter, is passionately addicted to the
pursuit of the Domestic Bee. I have described the contests between the
victim and her executioner, at greater length, elsewhere. The Bee appears, seeking no quarrel, intent upon plunder. She tests
the flowers with her tongue; she selects a spot that will yield a good
return. Soon she is wrapped up in her harvesting. While she is filling
her baskets and distending her crop, the Thomisus, that bandit lurking
under cover of the flowers, issues from her hiding-place, creeps round
behind the bustling insect, steals up close and, with a sudden rush,
nabs her in the nape of the neck. In vain, the Bee protests and darts
her sting at random; the assailant does not let go. Besides, the bite in the neck is paralysing, because the cervical
nerve-centres are affected. The poor thing's legs stiffen; and all is
over in a second. The murderess now sucks the victim's blood at her ease
and, when she has done, scornfully flings the drained corpse aside. She
hides herself once more, ready to bleed a second gleaner should the
occasion offer. This slaughter of the Bee engaged in the hallowed delights of labour
has always revolted me. Why should there be workers to feed idlers, why
sweated to keep sweaters in luxury? Why should so many admirable lives
be sacrificed to the greater prosperity of brigandage? These hateful
discords amid the general harmony perplex the thinker, all the more as
we shall see the cruel vampire become a model of devotion where her
family is concerned. The ogre loved his children; he ate the children of others. Under the
tyranny of the stomach, we are all of us, beasts and men alike, ogres. The dignity of labour, the joy of life, maternal affection, the terrors
of death: all these do not count, in others; the main point is that
morsel the be tender and savoury. According to the etymology of her name–Î¸ÏÎ¼Î¹Î³Î¾, a cord–the Thomisus
should be like the ancient lictor, who bound the sufferer to the stake. The comparison is not inappropriate as regards many Spiders who tie
their prey with a thread to subdue it and consume it at their ease; but
it just happens that the Thomisus is at variance with her label. She
does not fasten her Bee, who, dying suddenly of a bite in the neck,
offers no resistance to her consumer. Carried away by his recollection
of the regular tactics, our Spider's godfather overlooked the exception;
he did not know of the perfidious mode of attack which renders the use
of a bow-string superfluous. Nor is the second name of onustus–loaded, burdened,
freighted–any too happily chosen. The fact that the Bee-huntress carries
a heavy paunch is no reason to refer to this as a distinctive
characteristic. Nearly all Spiders have a voluminous belly, a
silk-warehouse where, in some cases, the rigging of the net, in others,
the swan's-down of the nest is manufactured. The Thomisus, a first-class
nest-builder, does like the rest: she hoards in her abdomen, but without
undue display of obesity, the wherewithal to house her family
snugly. Can the expression onustus refer simply to her slow and
sidelong walk? The explanation appeals to me, without satisfying me
fully. Except in the case of a sudden alarm, every Spider maintains a
sober gait and a wary pace. When all is said, the scientific term is
composed of a misconception and a worthless epithet. How difficult it is
to name animals rationally! Let us be indulgent to the nomenclator: the
dictionary is becoming exhausted and the constant flood that requires
cataloguing mounts incessantly, wearing out our combinations of
syllables. As the technical name tells the reader nothing, how shall he be
informed? I see but one means, which is to invite him to the May
festivals, in the waste-lands of the South. The murderess of the Bees is
of a chilly constitution; in our parts, she hardly ever moves away from
the olive-districts. Her favourite shrub is the white-leaved rock-rose
(Cistus albidus), with the large, pink, crumpled, ephemeral
blooms that last but a morning and are replaced, next day, by fresh
flowers, which have blossomed in the cool dawn. This glorious
efflorescence goes on for five or six weeks. Here, the Bees plunder enthusiastically, fussing and bustling in the
spacious whorl of the stamens, which beflour them with yellow. Their
persecutrix knows of this affluence. She posts herself in her
watch-house, under the rosy screen of a petal. Cast your eyes over the
flower, more or less everywhere. If you see a Bee lying lifeless, with
legs and tongue out-stretched, draw nearer: the Thomisus will be there,
nine times out of ten. The thug has struck her blow; she is draining the
blood of the departed. After all, this cutter of Bees' throats is a pretty, a very pretty
creature, despite her unwieldy paunch fashioned like a squat pyramid and
embossed on the base, on either side, with a pimple shaped like a
camel's hump. The skin, more pleasing to the eye than any satin, is
milk-white in some, in others lemon-yellow. There are fine ladies among
them who adorn their legs with a number of pink bracelets and their back
with carmine arabesques. A narrow pale-green ribbon sometimes edges the
right and left of the breast. It is not so rich as the costume of the
Banded Epeira, but much more elegant because of its soberness, its
daintiness and the artful blending of its hues. Novice fingers, which
shrink from touching any other Spider, allow themselves to be enticed by
these attractions; they do not fear to handle the beauteous Thomisus, so
gentle in appearance. Well, what can this gem among Spiders do? In the first place, she
makes a nest worthy of its architect. With twigs and horse-hair and bits
of wool, the Goldfinch, the Chaffinch and other masters of the builder's
art construct an aerial bower in the fork of the branches. Herself a
lover of high places, the Thomisus selects as the site of her nest one
of the upper twigs of the rock-rose, her regular hunting-ground, a twig
withered by the heat and possessing a few dead leaves, which curl into a
little cottage. This is where she settles with a view to her eggs. Ascending and descending with a gentle swing in more or less every
direction, the living shuttle, swollen with silk, weaves a bag whose
outer casing becomes one with the dry leaves around. The work, which is
partly visible and partly hidden by its supports, is a pure dead-white. Its shape, moulded in the angular interval between the bent leaves, is
that of a cone and reminds us, on a smaller scale, of the nest of the
Silky Epeira. When the eggs are laid, the mouth of the receptacle is hermetically
closed with a lid of the same white silk. Lastly, a few threads,
stretched like a thin curtain, form a canopy above the nest and, with
the curved tips of the leaves, frame a sort of alcove wherein the mother
takes up her abode. It is more than a place of rest after the fatigues of her
confinement: it is a guard-room, an inspection-post where the mother
remains sprawling until the youngsters' exodus. Greatly emaciated by the
laying of her eggs and by her expenditure of silk, she lives only for
the protection of her nest. Should some vagrant pass near by, she hurries from her watch-tower,
lifts a limb and puts the intruder to flight. If I tease her with a
straw, she parries with big gestures, like those of a prize-fighter. She
uses her fists against my weapon. When I propose to dislodge her in view
of certain experiments, I find some difficulty in doing so. She clings
to the silken floor, she frustrates my attacks, which I am bound to
moderate lest I should injure her. She is no sooner attracted outside
than she stubbornly returns to her post. She declines to leave her
treasure. Even so does the Narbonne Lycosa struggle when we try to take away
her pill. Each displays the same pluck and the same devotion; and also
the same denseness in distinguishing her property from that of others. The Lycosa accepts without hesitation any strange pill which she is,
given in exchange for her own; she confuses alien produce with the
produce of her ovaries and her silk-factory. Those hallowed words,
maternal love, were out of place here: it is an impetuous, an almost
mechanical impulse, wherein real affection plays no part whatever. The
beautiful Spider of the rock-roses is no more generously endowed. When
moved from her nest to another of the same kind, she settles upon it and
never stirs from it, even though the different arrangement of the leafy
fence be such as to warn her that she is not really at home. Provided
that she have satin under her feet, she does not notice her mistake; she
watches over another's nest with the same vigilance which she might show
in watching over her own. The Lycosa surpasses her in maternal blindness. She fastens to her
spinnerets and dangles, by way of a bag of eggs, a ball of cork polished
with my file, a paper pellet, a little ball of thread. In order to
discover if the Thomisus is capable of a similar error, I gathered some
broken pieces of silk-worm's cocoon into a closed cone, turning the
fragments so as to bring the smoother and more delicate inner surface
outside. My attempt was unsuccessful. When removed from her home and
placed on the artificial wallet, the mother Thomisus obstinately refused
to settle there. Can she be more clear-sighted than the Lycosa? Perhaps
so.
