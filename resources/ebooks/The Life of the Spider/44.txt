Wherefore the work is
generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly attracts
attention. My captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially
textile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa delights
in tall turrets. She understands the art of donjon-building and puts it
into practice as often as she possesses the means. This art is akin to another, from which it is apparently derived. If
the sun be fierce or if rain threaten, the Lycosa closes the entrance to
her dwelling with a silken trellis-work, wherein she embeds different
matters, often the remnants of victims which she has devoured. The
ancient Gael nailed the heads of his vanquished enemies to the door of
his hut. In the same way, the fierce Spider sticks the skulls of her
prey into the lid of her cave. These lumps look very well on the ogre's
roof; but we must be careful not to mistake them for warlike trophies. The animal knows nothing of our barbarous bravado.
