The quarters, the half-hours pass: nothing. The
Spider goes down again: she has probably judged the attempt too
dangerous. I move to a second, a third, a fourth burrow: still nothing;
the huntress refuses to leave her lair. Fortune at last smiles upon my patience, which has been heavily tried
by all these prudent retreats and particularly by the fierce heat of the
dog-days. A Spider suddenly rushes from her hole: she has been rendered
warlike, doubtless, by prolonged abstinence. The tragedy that happens
under the cover of the bottle lasts for but the twinkling of an eye. It
is over: the sturdy Carpenter-bee is dead. Where did the murderess
strike her? That is easily ascertained: the Tarantula has not let go;
and her fangs are planted in the nape of the neck. The assassin has the
knowledge which I suspected: she has made for the essentially vital
centre, she has stung the insect's cervical ganglia with her
poison-fangs. In short, she has bitten the only point a lesion in which
produces sudden death. I was delighted with this murderous skill, which
made amends for the blistering which my skin received in the sun. Once is not custom: one swallow does not make a summer. Is what I
have just seen due to accident or to premeditation?
