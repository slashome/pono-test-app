It is simply due to the conditions prevailing in my
menagerie. In their natural state, the Epeirae settle separately, at long
distances from one another. Each has her own hunting-grounds, where
there is no reason to fear the competition that would result from the
close proximity of the nets. In my cages, on the other hand, there is
cohabitation. In order to save space, I lodge two or three Epeirae in
the same cage. My easy-going captives live together in peace.
