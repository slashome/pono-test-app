All day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing
a storm. In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a
shrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to
renew her web at the regular hour. Her forecast is correct: it will be a
fine night. See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,
through the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively. I too, lantern in
hand, am peeping. A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on
high; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below. The Moths
begin their nightly rounds. Good!
