In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have
all the appearance of a mere kiss. Besides, it is made anywhere, at the
first spot that offers. The expert slayers {33} employ methods of the highest precision:
they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they wound the
cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy. The paralyzers, those
accomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which they
know the number and position. The Epeira possesses none of this fearsome
knowledge. She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does her sting. She does not select one spot rather than another; she bites
indifferently at whatever comes within reach. This being so, her poison
would have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like
inertia no matter which the point attacked. I can scarcely believe in
instantaneous death resulting from the bite, especially in the case of
insects, with their highly-resistant organisms. Besides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds
on blood much more than on flesh? It were to her advantage to suck a
live body, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the
pulsation of the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must
act more freely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids. The
game which the Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead. This is easily ascertained.
