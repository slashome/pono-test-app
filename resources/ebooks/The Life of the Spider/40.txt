I have installed her in large earthen pans on
the window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes. Well,
it is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her
hole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm. We may take it, then, that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does
not go far afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and
that she makes shift with what she finds upon her threshold. In these
conditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry
ceases for lack of materials. The wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice
would assume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply. With
captives to whom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough. Were
it only with a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these
relations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how my
subjects are housed. A good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a
red, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the
places haunted by the Lycosa. Properly moistened into a paste, the
artificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a
bore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow. When the receptacle
is filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,
perpendicular shaft. I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that of
the fields. To find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in
the neighbourhood. When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned
topsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced
by my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den. She does not
come out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere.
