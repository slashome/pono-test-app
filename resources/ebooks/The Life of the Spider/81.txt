The first show us the
secrets of their looms without much difficulty; the others conceal them
from us. Work starts in July, a couple of hours before sunset. The spinstresses of my enclosure then leave their daytime
hiding-places, select their posts and begin to spin, one here, another
there. There are many of them; we can choose where we please. Let us
stop in front of this one, whom we surprise in the act of laying the
foundations of the structure. Without any appreciable order, she runs
about the rosemary-hedge, from the tip of one branch to another within
the limits of some eighteen inches. Gradually, she puts a thread in
position, drawing it from her wire-mill with the combs attached to her
hind-legs. This preparatory work presents no appearance of a concerted
plan. The Spider comes and goes impetuously, as though at random; she
goes up, comes down, goes up again, dives down again and each time
strengthens the points of contact with intricate moorings distributed
here and there. The result is a scanty and disordered scaffolding. Is disordered the word? Perhaps not.
