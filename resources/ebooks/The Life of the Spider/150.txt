Everywhere, the
searching straw encounters resistance; everywhere, it finds the place
rigorously closed. But one of the scallops, differing in no wise from
the others in appearance, if cleverly coaxed, opens at the edge into two
lips and stands slightly ajar. This is the door, which at once shuts
again of its own elasticity. Nor is this all: the Spider, when she
returns home, often bolts herself in, that is to say, she joins and
fastens the two leaves of the door with a little silk. The Mason Mygale is no safer in her burrow, with its lid
undistinguishable from the soil and moving on a hinge, than is the
Clotho in her tent, which is inviolable by any enemy ignorant of the
device. The Clotho, when in danger, runs quickly home; she opens the
chink with a touch of her claw, enters and disappears. The door closes
of itself and is supplied, in case of need, with a lock consisting of a
few threads. No burglar, led astray by the multiplicity of arches, one
and all alike, will ever discover how the fugitive vanished so
suddenly. While the Clotho displays a more simple ingenuity as regards her
defensive machinery, she is incomparably ahead of the Mygale in the
matter of domestic comfort. Let us open her cabin.
