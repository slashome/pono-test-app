What an entrance into the world! Clutching its aeronautic
thread, the minute creature mounts in an apotheosis. Sooner or later, nearer or farther, the fall comes. To live, we have
to descend, often very low, alas! The Crested Lark crumbles the
mule-droppings in the road and thus picks up his food, the oaten grain
which he would never find by soaring in the sky, his throat swollen with
song. We have to descend; the stomach's inexorable claims demand it. The
Spiderling, therefore, touches land. Gravity, tempered by the parachute,
is kind to her. The rest of her story escapes me. What infinitely tiny Midges does
she capture before possessing the strength to stab her Bee? What are the
methods, what the wiles of atom contending with atom? I know not.
