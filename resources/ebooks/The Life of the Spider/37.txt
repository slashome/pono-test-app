The youngsters may be brushed off by
a blade of grass. What becomes of them when they have a fall? Does the
mother give them a thought? Does she come to their assistance and help
them to regain their place on her back? Not at all. The affection of a
Spider's heart, divided among some hundreds, can spare but a very feeble
portion to each. The Lycosa hardly troubles, whether one youngster fall
from his place, or six, or all of them. She waits impassively for the
victims of the mishap to get out of their own difficulty, which they do,
for that matter, and very nimbly. I sweep the whole family from the back of one of my boarders with a
hair-pencil. Not a sign of emotion, not an attempt at search on the part
of the denuded one. After trotting about a little on the sand, the
dislodged youngsters find, these here, those there, one or other of the
mother's legs, spread wide in a circle. By means of these
climbing-poles, they swarm to the top and soon the dorsal group resumes
its original form. Not one of the lot is missing. The Lycosa's sons know
their trade as acrobats to perfection: the mother need not trouble her
head about their fall. With a sweep of the pencil, I make the family of one Spider fall
around another laden with her own family. The dislodged ones nimbly
scramble up the legs and climb on the back of their new mother, who
kindly allows them to behave as though they belonged to her. There is no
room on the abdomen, the regulation resting-place, which is already
occupied by the real sons. The invaders thereupon encamp on the front
part, beset the thorax and change the carrier into a horrible
pin-cushion that no longer bears the least resemblance to a Spider form. Meanwhile, the sufferer raises no sort of protest against this access of
family. She placidly accepts them all and walks them all about.
