Not entirely. A mythological name came to his mind, one
which sounded well and which, moreover, was not out of place in
designating a spinstress. The Clotho of antiquity is the youngest of the
three Fates; she holds the distaff whence our destinies are spun, a
distaff wound with plenty of rough flocks, just a few shreds of silk
and, very rarely, a thin strand of gold. Prettily shaped and clad, as far as a Spider can be, the Clotho of
the naturalists is, above all, a highly talented spinstress; and this is
the reason why she is called after the distaff-bearing deity of the
infernal regions. It is a pity that the analogy extends no further. The
mythological Clotho, niggardly with her silk and lavish with her coarse
flocks, spins us a harsh existence; the eight-legged Clotho uses naught
but exquisite silk. She works for herself; the other works for us, who
are hardly worth the trouble.
