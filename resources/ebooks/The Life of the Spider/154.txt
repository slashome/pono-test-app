I loosen the fastenings with my
pocket-knife. The Spider has such stay-at-home ways that she very rarely
makes off. Besides, I use the utmost discretion in my rape of the house. And so I carry away the building, together with its owner, in a paper
bag. The flat stones, which are too heavy to move and which would occupy
too much room upon my table, are replaced either by deal disks, which
once formed part of cheese-boxes, or by round pieces of cardboard. I
arrange each silken hammock under one of these by itself, fastening the
angular projections, one by one, with strips of gummed paper. The whole
stands on three short pillars and gives a very fair imitation of the
underrock shelter in the form of a small dolmen. Throughout this
operation, if you are careful to avoid shocks and jolts, the Spider
remains indoors. Finally, each apparatus is placed under a wire-gauze,
bell-shaped cage, which stands in a dish filled with sand. We can have an answer by the next morning. If, among the cabins swung
from the ceilings of the deal or cardboard dolmens, there be one that is
all dilapidated, that was seriously knocked out of shape at the time of
removal, the Spider abandons it during the night and instals herself
elsewhere, sometimes even on the trellis-work of the wire cage. The new tent, the work of a few hours, attains hardly the diameter of
a two-franc piece. It is built, however, on the same principles as the
old manor-house and consists of two thin sheets laid one above the
other, the upper one flat and forming a tester, the lower curved and
pocket-shaped.
