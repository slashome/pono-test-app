Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite has
disappeared. Their movements become more uncertain, as though hampered
by irresistible torpor. On the second day, they are dead, every one
irrecoverably dead. The Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her
delicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness, which
gives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without the least
risk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture. The meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to
the very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a
favourable condition for the exhausting of the juices. Once again, we
see a skilful method of slaughter, very different from the tactics in
use among the expert paralyzers or slayers. Here there is no display of
anatomical science. Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the
Spider stabs at random. The virulence of the poison does the rest. There are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily
mortal. My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest
Dragon-fly in my district (AEshna grandis, LIN.). I myself had
entangled in the web this head of big game, which is not often captured
by the Epeirae. The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its
moorings. The Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the
giantess, flings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further
precautions, grips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs
her fangs into the Dragon-fly's back. The bite is prolonged in such a
way as to astonish me. This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am
already familiar; it is a deep, determined wound. After striking her
blow, the Spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison
to take effect. I at once remove the Dragon-fly. She is dead, really and truly dead.
