When patiently entreated, the least of creatures adds its note
to the harmonies of life. In the fields around, traversed, in these days, with a tired step,
but still vigilantly explored, I find nothing so often as the Labyrinth
Spider (Agelena labyrinthica, CLERCK.). Not a hedge but
shelters a few at its foot, amidst grass, in quiet, sunny nooks. In the
open country and especially in hilly places laid bare by the wood-man's
axe, the favourite sites are tufts of bracken, rock-rose, lavender,
everlasting and rosemary cropped close by the teeth of the flocks. This
is where I resort, as the isolation and kindliness of the supports lend
themselves to proceedings which might not be tolerated by the unfriendly
hedge. Several times a week, in July, I go to study my Spiders on the spot,
at an early hour, before the sun beats fiercely on one's neck. The
children accompany me, each provided with an orange wherewith to slake
the thirst that will not be slow in coming.
