Even so. I see hastening up from the neighbouring bushes and
embarking on the cable a male, a dwarf, who is coming, the
whipper-snapper, to pay his respects to the portly giantess. How has he,
in his distant corner, heard of the presence of the nymph ripe for
marriage? Among the Spiders, these things are learnt in the silence of
the night, without a summons, without a signal, none knows how. Once, the Great Peacock, {32} apprised by the magic effluvia, used to come
from miles around to visit the recluse in her bell-jar in my study. The
dwarf of this evening, that other nocturnal pilgrim, crosses the
intricate tangle of the branches without a mistake and makes straight
for the rope-walker. He has as his guide the infallible compass that
brings every Jack and his Jill together. He climbs the slope of the suspension-cord; he advances
circumspectly, step by step. He stops some distance away, irresolute. Shall he go closer? Is this the right moment?
