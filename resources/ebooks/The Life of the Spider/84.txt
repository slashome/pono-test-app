Before
continuing, it is necessary to lay a converse group which will maintain
the whole by its resistance. Any combination of forces acting in one
direction must be forthwith neutralized by another in the opposite
direction. This is what our statics teach us and what the Spider puts
into practice; she is a past mistress of the secrets of rope-building,
without serving an apprenticeship. One would think that this interrupted and apparently disordered
labour must result in a confused piece of work. Wrong: the rays are
equidistant and form a beautifully-regular orb. Their number is a
characteristic mark of the different species. The Angular Epeira places
21 in her web, the Banded Epeira 32, the Silky Epeira 42. These numbers
are not absolutely fixed; but the variation is very slight. Now which of us would undertake, off-hand, without much preliminary
experiment and without measuring-instruments, to divide a circle into a
given quantity of sectors of equal width? The Epeirae, though weighted
with a wallet and tottering on threads shaken by the wind, effect the
delicate division without stopping to think. They achieve it by a method
which seems mad according to our notions of geometry. Out of disorder
they evolve order. We must not, however, give them more than their due. The angles are
only approximately equal; they satisfy the demands of the eye, but
cannot stand the test of strict measurement. Mathematical precision
would be superfluous here.
