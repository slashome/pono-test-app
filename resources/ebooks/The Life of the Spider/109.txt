It is the first week of August, at about nine o'clock in the evening,
under a perfect sky, in calm, hot weather. The Spider has not yet
constructed her web and is sitting motionless on her suspension-cable. The fact that she should be slacking like this, at a time when her
building-operations ought to be in full swing, naturally astonishes me.
