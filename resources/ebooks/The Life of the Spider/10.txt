A
gasp proclaims that all is over. The bird is dead. There was a certain coolness among us at the evening-meal. I read
mute reproaches, because of my experiment, in the eyes of my
home-circle; I read an unspoken accusation of cruelty all around me. The
death of the unfortunate Sparrow had saddened the whole family. I myself
was not without some remorse of conscience: the poor result achieved
seemed to me too dearly bought. I am not made of the stuff of those who,
without turning a hair, rip up live Dogs to find out nothing in
particular. Nevertheless, I had the courage to start afresh, this time on a Mole
caught ravaging a bed of lettuces. There was a danger lest my captive,
with his famished stomach, should leave things in doubt, if we had to
keep him for a few days. He might die not of his wound, but of
inanition, if I did not succeed in giving him suitable food, fairly
plentiful and dispensed at fairly frequent intervals. In that case, I
ran a risk of ascribing to the poison what might well be the result of
starvation. I must therefore begin by finding out if it was possible for
me to keep the Mole alive in captivity. The animal was put into a large
receptacle from which it could not get out and fed on a varied diet of
insects–Beetles, Grasshoppers, especially Cicadae {15}–which it crunched up with an excellent
appetite. Twenty-four hours of this regimen convinced me that the Mole
was making the best of the bill of fare and taking kindly to his
captivity. I make the Tarantula bite him at the tip of the snout. When replaced
in his cage, the Mole keeps on scratching his nose with his broad paws. The thing seems to burn, to itch. Henceforth, less and less of the
provision of Cicadae is consumed; on the evening of the following day,
it is refused altogether. About thirty-six hours after being bitten, the
Mole dies during the night and certainly not from inanition, for there
are still half a dozen live Cicadae in the receptacle, as well as a few
Beetles. The bite of the Black-bellied Tarantula is therefore dangerous to
other animals than insects: it is fatal to the Sparrow, it is fatal to
the Mole. Up to what point are we to generalize? I do not know, because
my enquiries extended no further. Nevertheless, judging from the little
that I saw, it appears to me that the bite of this Spider is not an
accident which man can afford to treat lightly. This is all that I have
to say to the doctors. To the philosophical entomologists I have something else to say: I
have to call their attention to the consummate knowledge of the
insect-killers, which vies with that of the paralyzers. I speak of
insect-killers in the plural, for the Tarantula must share her deadly
art with a host of other Spiders, especially with those who hunt without
nets. These insect-killers, who live on their prey, strike the game dead
instantaneously by stinging the nerve-centres of the neck; the
paralyzers, on the other hand, who wish to keep the food fresh for their
larvae, destroy the power of movement by stinging the game in the other
nerve-centres. Both of them attack the nervous chain, but they select
the point according to the object to be attained. If death be desired,
sudden death, free from danger to the huntress, the insect is attacked
in the neck; if mere paralysis be required, the neck is respected and
the lower segments–sometimes one alone, sometimes three, sometimes all
or nearly all, according to the special organization of the
victim–receive the dagger-thrust. Even the paralyzers, at least some of them, are acquainted with the
immense vital importance of the nerve-centres of the neck. We have seen
the Hairy Ammophila munching the caterpillar's brain, the Languedocian
Sphex munching the brain of the Ephippigera, with the object of inducing
a passing torpor. But they simply squeeze the brain and do even this
with a wise discretion; they are careful not to drive their sting into
this fundamental centre of life; not one of them ever thinks of doing
so, for the result would be a corpse which the larva would despise. The
Spider, on the other hand, inserts her double dirk there and there
alone; any elsewhere it would inflict a wound likely to increase
resistance through irritation. She wants a venison for consumption
without delay and brutally thrusts her fangs into the spot which the
others so conscientiously respect. If the instinct of these scientific murderers is not, in both cases,
an inborn predisposition, inseparable from the animal, but an acquired
habit, then I rack my brain in vain to understand how that habit can
have been acquired. Shroud these facts in theoretic mists as much as you
will, you shall never succeed in veiling the glaring evidence which they
afford of a pre-established order of things. CHAPTER II:
THE BANDED EPEIRA

In the inclement season of the year, when the insect has nothing to
do and retires to winter quarters, the observer profits by the mildness
of the sunny nooks and grubs in the sand, lifts the stones, searches the
brushwood; and often he is stirred with a pleasurable excitement, when
he lights upon some ingenious work of art, discovered unawares. Happy
are the simple of heart whose ambition is satisfied with such
treasure-trove! I wish them all the joys which it has brought me and
which it will continue to bring me, despite the vexations of life, which
grow ever more bitter as the years follow their swift downward
course. Should the seekers rummage among the wild grasses in the osier-beds
and copses, I wish them the delight of finding the wonderful object
that, at this moment, lies before my eyes. It is the work of a Spider,
the nest of the Banded Epeira (Epeira fasciata, LATR.). A Spider is not an insect, according to the rules of classification;
and as such the Epeira seems out of place here. {16} A fig for systems! It is immaterial to the
student of instinct whether the animal have eight legs instead of six,
or pulmonary sacs instead of air-tubes. Besides, the Araneida belong to
the group of segmented animals, organized in sections placed end to end,
a structure to which the terms insect' and entomology' both refer. Formerly, to describe this group, people said articulate animals,'
an expression which possessed the drawback of not jarring on the ear and
of being understood by all. This is out of date. Nowadays, they use the
euphonious term Arthropoda.' And to think that there are men who
question the existence of progress! Infidels! Say, articulate,' first;
then roll out, Arthropoda;' and you shall see whether zoological
science is not progressing! In bearing and colouring, Epeira fasciata is the handsomest
of the Spiders of the South. On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse
nearly as large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver
sashes, to which she owes her epithet of Banded. Around that portly
abdomen, the eight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings,
radiate like spokes. Any small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for
her web, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,
wherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits. As a rule,
because of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across
some brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes. She also stretches
them, but not assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the
slopes with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers. Her hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary,
which varies according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to
the neighbouring branches by a number of moorings. The structure is that
adopted by the other weaving Spiders. Straight threads radiate at equal
intervals from a central point. Over this framework runs a continuous
spiral thread, forming chords, or cross-bars, from the centre to the
circumference. It is magnificently large and magnificently
symmetrical. In the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque
ribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii. This is the Epeira's
trade-mark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation. Fecit So-and-so,' she seems to say, when giving the last throw
of the shuttle to her handiwork. That the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing
from spoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the
work achieved ensures her food for a few days to come. But, in this
particular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the
matter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to
the web. Increased resistance is not superfluous, for the net is sometimes
exposed to severe tests. The Epeira cannot pick and choose her prizes. Seated motionless in the centre of her web, her eight legs wide-spread
to feel the shaking of the network in any direction, she waits for what
luck will bring her: now some giddy weakling unable to control its
flight, anon some powerful prey rushing headlong with a reckless
bound. The Locust in particular, the fiery Locust, who releases the spring
of his long shanks at random, often falls into the trap. One imagines
that his strength ought to frighten the Spider; the kick of his spurred
levers should enable him to make a hole, then and there, in the web and
to get away. But not at all. If he does not free himself at the first
effort, the Locust is lost. Turning her back on the game, the Epeira works all her spinnerets,
pierced like the rose of a watering-pot, at one and the same time. The
silky spray is gathered by the hind-legs, which are longer than the
others and open into a wide arc to allow the stream to spread. Thanks to
this artifice, the Epeira this time obtains not a thread, but an
iridescent sheet, a sort of clouded fan wherein the component threads
are kept almost separate. The two hind-legs fling this shroud gradually,
by rapid alternate armfuls, while, at the same time, they turn the prey
over and over, swathing it completely. The ancient retiarius, when pitted against a powerful wild
beast, appeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left
shoulder. The animal made its spring. The man, with a sudden movement of
his right arm, cast the net after the manner of the fishermen; he
covered the beast and tangled it in the meshes. A thrust of the trident
gave the quietus to the vanquished foe. The Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is
able to renew her armful of fetters. Should the first not suffice, a
second instantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves
of silk become exhausted. When all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider
goes up to her bound prisoner. She has a better weapon than the
bestiarius' trident: she has her poison-fangs. She gnaws at the
Locust, without undue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the
torpid patient to pine away. Soon she comes back to her motionless head of game: she sucks it,
drains it, repeatedly changing her point of attack. At last, the
clean-bled remains are flung out of the net and the Spider returns to
her ambush in the centre of the web. What the Epeira sucks is not a corpse, but a numbed body. If I remove
the Locust immediately after he has been bitten and release him from the
silken sheath, the patient recovers his strength to such an extent that
he seems, at first, to have suffered no injury. The Spider, therefore,
does not kill her capture before sucking its juices; she is content to
deprive it of the power of motion by producing a state of torpor. Perhaps this kindlier bite gives her greater facility in working her
pump. The humours, if stagnant, in a corpse, would not respond so
readily to the action of the sucker; they are more easily extracted from
a live body, in which they move about. The Epeira, therefore, being a drinker of blood, moderates the
virulence of her sting, even with victims of appalling size, so sure is
she of her retiarian art. The long-legged Tryxalis, {17} the corpulent Grey Locust, the largest of
our Grasshoppers are accepted without hesitation and sucked dry as soon
as numbed. Those giants, capable of making a hole in the net and passing
through it in their impetuous onrush, can be but rarely caught. I myself
place them on the web.
