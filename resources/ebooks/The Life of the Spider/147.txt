Most men disappear without leaving an echo to
repeat their name; they lie buried in forgetfulness, the worst of
graves. Others, among the naturalists, benefit by the designation given to
this or that object in life's treasure-house: it is the skiff wherein
they keep afloat for a brief while. A patch of lichen on the bark of an
old tree, a blade of grass, a puny beastie: any one of these hands down
a man's name to posterity as effectively as a new comet. For all its
abuses, this manner of honouring the departed is eminently respectable. If we would carve an epitaph of some duration, what could we find better
than a Beetle's wing-case, a Snail's shell or a Spider's web? Granite is
worth none of them. Entrusted to the hard stone, an inscription becomes
obliterated; entrusted to a Butterfly's wing, it is indestructible. Durand,' therefore, by all means. But why drag in Clotho'? Is it the whim of a nomenclator, at a loss
for words to denote the ever-swelling tide of beasts that require
cataloguing?
