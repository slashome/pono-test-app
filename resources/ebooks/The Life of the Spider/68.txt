Unfortunately, my
troop, which has been greatly reduced by the number of departures
through the window, does not lend itself to prolonged experiment. We
must begin again. The next morning, on the same yucca, I gather the second family, as
numerous as the first. Yesterday's preparations are repeated. My legion
of Spiders first weaves a divergent framework between the top of the
brushwood placed at the emigrants' disposal and the edge of the table. Five or six hundred wee beasties swarm all over this work-yard. While this little world is busily fussing, making its arrangements
for departure, I make my own. Every aperture in the room is closed, so
as to obtain as calm an atmosphere as possible.
