She
arrives in a flash. How is she apprised? Let us explain the matter. The alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the
sight of the captured object. A very simple experiment will prove this. I lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second
asphyxiated with carbon disulphide. The carcass is placed in front, or
behind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the centre
of the net. If the test is to be applied to a species with a daytime
hiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the web, more
or less near the centre, no matter how. In both cases, nothing happens at first.
