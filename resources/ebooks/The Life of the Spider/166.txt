No, it is a reality in the service of life, a method of construction
frequently employed in animal architecture. The Mollusc, in particular,
never rolls the winding ramp of the shell without reference to the
scientific curve. The first-born of the species knew it and put it into
practice; it was as perfect in the dawn of creation as it can be
to-day. Let us study, in this connection, the Ammonites, those venerable
relics of what was once the highest expression of living things, at the
time when the solid land was taking shape from the oceanic ooze. Cut and
polished length-wise, the fossil shows a magnificent logarithmic spiral,
the general pattern of the dwelling which was a pearl palace, with
numerous chambers traversed by a siphuncular corridor. To this day, the last representative of the Cephalopoda with
partitioned shells, the Nautilus of the Southern Seas, remains faithful
to the ancient design; it has not improved upon its distant
predecessors. It has altered the position of the siphuncle, has placed
it in the centre instead of leaving it on the back, but it still whirls
its spiral logarithmically as did the Ammonites in the earliest ages of
the world's existence. And let us not run away with the idea that these princes of the
Mollusc tribe have a monopoly of the scientific curve. In the stagnant
waters of our grassy ditches, the flat shells, the humble Planorbes,
sometimes no bigger than a duckweed, vie with the Ammonite and the
Nautilus in matters of higher geometry. At least one of them,
Planorbis vortex, for example, is a marvel of logarithmic
whorls. In the long-shaped shells, the structure becomes more complex, though
remaining subject to the same fundamental laws. I have before my eyes
some species of the genus Terebra, from New Caledonia. They are
extremely tapering cones, attaining almost nine inches in length. Their
surface is smooth and quite plain, without any of the usual ornaments,
such as furrows, knots or strings of pearls. The spiral edifice is
superb, graced with its own simplicity alone. I count a score of whorls
which gradually decrease until they vanish in the delicate point. They
are edged with a fine groove. I take a pencil and draw a rough generating line to this cone; and,
relying merely on the evidence of my eyes, which are more or less
practised in geometric measurements, I find that the spiral groove
intersects this generating line at an angle of unvarying value. The consequence of this result is easily deduced. If projected on a
plane perpendicular to the axis of the shell, the generating lines of
the cone would become radii; and the groove which winds upwards from the
base to the apex would be converted into a plane curve which, meeting
those radii at an unvarying angle, would be neither more nor less than a
logarithmic spiral. Conversely, the groove of the shell may be
considered as the projection of this spiral on a conic surface. Better still. Let us imagine a plane perpendicular to the aids of the
shell and passing through its summit. Let us imagine, moreover, a thread
wound along the spiral groove. Let us unroll the thread, holding it taut
as we do so. Its extremity will not leave the plane and will describe a
logarithmic spiral within it. It is, in a more complicated degree, a
variant of Bernouilli's Â˜Eadem mutata resurgo:' the logarithmic
conic curve becomes a logarithmic plane curve. A similar geometry is found in the other shells with elongated cones,
Turritellae, Spindle-shells, Cerithia, as well as in the shells with
flattened cones, Trochidae, Turbines. The spherical shells, those
whirled into a volute, are no exception to this rule. All, down to the
common Snail-shell, are constructed according to logarithmic laws. The
famous spiral of the geometers is the general plan followed by the
Mollusc rolling its stone sheath. Where do these glairy creatures pick up this science? We are told
that the Mollusc derives from the Worm. One day, the Worm, rendered
frisky by the sun, emancipated itself, brandished its tail and twisted
it into a corkscrew for sheer glee. There and then the plan of the
future spiral shell was discovered. This is what is taught quite seriously, in these days, as the very
last word in scientific progress.
