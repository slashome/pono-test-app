Let us state them briefly. The hatching takes place as March approaches. When this time comes,
let us open the Banded Epeira's nest with the scissors. We shall find
that some of the youngsters have already left the central chamber and
scattered over the surrounding eiderdown, while the rest of the laying
still consists of a compact mass of orange eggs. The appearance of the
younglings is not simultaneous; it takes place with intermissions and
may last a couple of weeks. Nothing as yet suggests the future, richly-striped livery. The
abdomen is white and, as it were, floury in the front half; in the other
half it is a blackish-brown. The rest of the body is pale-yellow, except
in front, where the eyes form a black edging. When left alone, the
little ones remain motionless in the soft, russet swan's-down; if
disturbed, they shuffle lazily where they are, or even walk about in a
hesitating and unsteady fashion. One can see that they have to ripen
before venturing outside. Maturity is achieved in the exquisite floss that surrounds the natal
chamber and fills out the balloon. This is the waiting-room in which the
body hardens. All dive into it as and when they emerge from the central
keg. They will not leave it until four months later, when the midsummer
heats have come. Their number is considerable.
