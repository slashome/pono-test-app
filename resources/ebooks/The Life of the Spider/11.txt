The Spider does the rest. Lavishing her silky
spray, she swathes them and then sucks the body at her ease. With an
increased expenditure of the spinnerets, the very biggest game is
mastered as successfully as the everyday prey. I have seen even better than that. This time, my subject is the Silky
Epeira (Epeira sericea, OLIV.), with a broad, festooned,
silvery abdomen. Like that of the other, her web is large, upright and
signed' with a zigzag ribbon. I place upon it a Praying Mantis, {18} a well-developed specimen, quite capable of
changing rÃ´les, should circumstances permit, and herself making a meal
off her assailant. It is a question no longer of capturing a peaceful
Locust, but a fierce and powerful ogre, who would rip open the Epeira's
paunch with one blow of her harpoons. Will the Spider dare? Not immediately. Motionless in the centre of
her net, she consults her strength before attacking the formidable
quarry; she waits until the struggling prey has its claws more thickly
entangled. At last, she approaches. The Mantis curls her belly; lifts
her wings like vertical sails; opens her saw-toothed arm-pieces; in
short, adopts the spectral attitude which she employs when delivering
battle. The Spider disregards these menaces. Spreading wide her spinnerets,
she pumps out sheets of silk which the hind-legs draw out, expand and
fling without stint in alternate armfuls. Under this shower of threads,
the Mantis' terrible saws, the lethal legs, quickly disappear from
sight, as do the wings, still erected in the spectral posture. Meanwhile, the swathed one gives sudden jerks, which make the Spider
fall out of her web. The accident is provided for. A safety-cord,
emitted at the same instant by the spinnerets, keeps the Epeira hanging,
swinging in space. When calm is restored, she packs her cord and climbs
up again.
