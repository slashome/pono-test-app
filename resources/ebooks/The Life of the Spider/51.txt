None, unless it be that
the season of strenuous burrowing is past. The instincts have a calendar
of their own. At the given hour, suddenly they awaken; as suddenly,
afterwards, they fall asleep. The ingenious become incompetent when the
prescribed period is ended. On a subject of this kind, we can consult the Spider of the
waste-lands. I catch an old Lycosa in the fields and house her, that
same day, under wire, in a burrow where I have prepared a soil to her
liking. If, by my contrivances and with a bit of reed, I have previously
moulded a burrow roughly representing the one from which I took her, the
Spider enters it forthwith and seems pleased with her new residence. The
product of my art is accepted as her lawful property and undergoes
hardly any alterations. In course of time, a bastion is erected around
the orifice; the top of the gallery is cemented with silk; and that is
all. In this establishment of my building, the animal's behaviour
remains what it would be under natural conditions. But place the Lycosa on the surface of the ground, without first
shaping a burrow. What will the homeless Spider do? Dig herself a
dwelling, one would think.
