I place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my
menagerie, one on this, another on that. The Spider comes rushing up,
binds the prey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite
to take effect. I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its
silken shroud. The Locust is not dead, far from it; one would even think
that he had suffered no harm. I examine the released prisoner through
the lens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound. Can he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given
to him just now? You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious
way in which he kicks in my fingers. Nevertheless, when put on the
ground, he walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop. Perhaps it is a
temporary trouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web.
