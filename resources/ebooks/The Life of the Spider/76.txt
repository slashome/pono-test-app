Nothing informs us, nothing suggests to us that
it will occur at one place rather than another. Moreover, to tell the truth, it is not a dehiscence prepared by means
of some dainty piece of mechanism; it is a very irregular tear. Somewhat
sharply, under the fierce heat of the sun, the satin bursts like the
rind of an over-ripe pomegranate. Judging by the result, we think of the
expansion of the air inside, which, heated by the sun, causes this
rupture. The signs of pressure from within are manifest: the tatters of
the torn fabric are turned outwards; also, a wisp of the russet
eiderdown that fills the wallet invariably straggles through the breach. In the midst of the protruding floss, the Spiderlings, expelled from
their home by the explosion, are in frantic commotion. The balloons of the Banded Epeira are bombs which, to free their
contents, burst under the rays of a torrid sun. To break they need the
fiery heat-waves of the dog-days. When kept in the moderate atmosphere
of my study, most of them do not open and the emergence of the young
does not take place, unless I myself I have a hand in the business; a
few others open with a round hole, a hole so neat that it might have
been made with a punch. This aperture is the work of the prisoners, who,
relieving one another in turns, have, with a patient tooth, bitten
through the stuff of the jar at some point or other. When exposed to the full force of the sun, however, on the rosemaries
in the enclosure, the balloons burst and shoot forth a ruddy flood of
floss and tiny animals. That is how things occur in the free sun-bath of
the fields. Unsheltered, among the bushes, the wallet of the Banded
Epeira, when the July heat arrives, splits under the effort of the inner
air. The delivery is effected by an explosion of the dwelling.
