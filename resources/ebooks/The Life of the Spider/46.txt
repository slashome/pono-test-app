In spite of the earthy casing, the silk woof
gives it the requisite pliancy to cleave when pushed by the anchorite
and to rip open without falling into ruins. Swept back to the
circumference of the mouth and increased by the wreckage of further
ceilings, it becomes a parapet, which the Lycosa raises by degrees in
her long moments of leisure. The bastion which surmounts the burrow,
therefore, takes its origin from the temporary lid. The turret derives
from the split ceiling. What is the purpose of this turret? My pans will tell us that. An
enthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently
fixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush
and wait for the quarry. Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my
captives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements
of their woolly castle-keep.
