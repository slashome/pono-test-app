She never goes out except to snap up
some game passing within her hunting-domains, near the burrow. At the
end of August, however, it is not unusual to meet her roaming about,
dragging her wallet behind her. Her hesitations make one think that she
is looking for her home, which she has left for the moment and has a
difficulty in finding. Why these rambles? There are two reasons: first the pairing and then
the making of the pill. There is a lack of space in the burrow, which
provides only room enough for the Spider engaged in long contemplation. Now the preparations for the egg-bag require an extensive flooring, a
supporting framework about the size of one's hand, as my caged prisoner
has shown us. The Lycosa has not so much space at her disposal, in her
well; hence the necessity for coming out and working at her wallet in
the open air, doubtless in the quiet hours of the night. The meeting with the male seems likewise to demand an excursion. Running the risk of being eaten alive, will he venture to plunge into
his lady's cave, into a lair whence flight would be impossible? It is
very doubtful. Prudence demands that matters should take place outside. Here at least there is some chance of beating a hasty retreat which will
enable the rash swain to escape the attacks of his horrible bride. The interview in the open air lessens the danger without removing it
entirely. We had proof of this when we caught the Lycosa in the act of
devouring her lover aboveground, in a part of the enclosure which had
been broken for planting and which was therefore not suitable for the
Spider's establishment. The burrow must have been some way off; and the
meeting of the pair took place at the very spot of the tragic
catastrophe. Although he had a clear road, the male was not quick enough
in getting away and was duly eaten. After this cannibal orgy, does the Lycosa go back home? Perhaps not,
for a while.
