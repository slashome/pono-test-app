I have often tried to place a
Tarantula and a Bumble-bee face to face in the same bottle. The two
animals mutually flee each other, each being as much upset as the other
at its captivity. I have kept them together for twenty-four hours,
without aggressive display on either side. Thinking more of their prison
than of attacking each other, they temporize, as though indifferent. The
experiment has always been fruitless. I have succeeded with Bees and
Wasps, but the murder has been committed at night and has taught me
nothing. I would find both insects, next morning, reduced to a jelly
under the Spider's mandibles. A weak prey is a mouthful which the Spider
reserves for the calm of the night. A prey capable of resistance is not
attacked in captivity.
