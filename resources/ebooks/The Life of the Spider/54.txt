Weeks pass and not an effort is made, not one. Demoralized by the absence of an ambush, the Lycosa hardly vouchsafes a
glance at the game which I serve up. The Crickets pass within her reach
in vain; most often she scorns them. She slowly wastes away with fasting
and boredom. At length, she dies. Take up your miner's trade again, poor fool! Make yourself a home,
since you know how to, and life will be sweet to you for many a long day
yet: the weather is fine and victuals plentiful. Dig, delve, go
underground, where safety lies. Like an idiot, you refrain; and you
perish. Why? Because the craft which you were wont to ply is forgotten; because
the days of patient digging are past and your poor brain is unable to
work back. To do a second time what has been done already is beyond your
wit.
