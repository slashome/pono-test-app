Two months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my
expectations. Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,
all picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built
themselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known. Around the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth
stones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement. The larger
stones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal
that has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others. On this rockwork stands the donjon. It is an interlacing of raphia
and bits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade. Red
and white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order. The
Lycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour. The ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high. Bands
of silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the whole
resembles a coarse fabric. Without being absolutely faultless, for there
are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker could not
handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit. The bird lining its
nest would do no better. Whoso sees the curious, many-coloured
productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my industry,
contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his surprise is
great when I confess who the real author is. No one would ever believe
the Spider capable of constructing such a monument. It goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren
waste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous architecture. I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home to go in search
of materials and she makes use of the limited resources which she finds
around her.
