Its size is
that of an average cherry. An observant eye will notice, running
horizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise
without breaking it. This hem, generally undistinguishable from the rest
of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat, drawn
over the lower hemisphere. The other hemisphere, through which the
youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is the
texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid. Inside, there is nothing but the eggs: no mattress, no soft
eiderdown, like that of the Epeirae. The Lycosa, indeed, has no need to
guard her eggs against the inclemencies of the winter, for the hatching
will take place long before the cold weather comes. Similarly, the
Thomisus, with her early brood, takes good care not to incur useless
expenditure: she gives her eggs, for their protection, a simple purse of
satin. The work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a
whole morning, from five to nine o'clock. Worn out with fatigue, the
mother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless. I shall see no
more to-day. Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs
slung from her stern. Henceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious
burden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags and
bumps along the ground. With this load banging against her heels, she
goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey, attacks
it and devours it. Should some accident cause the wallet to drop off, it
is soon replaced. The spinnerets touch it somewhere, anywhere, and that
is enough: adhesion is at once restored. The Lycosa is a stay-at-home.
