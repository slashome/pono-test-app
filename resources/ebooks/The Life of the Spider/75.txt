Remember the details given in an earlier chapter. The
neck of the balloon ends in a wide crater, which is closed by a ceiling
dug out cup-wise. The material is as stout in this part as in any other;
but, as the lid was the finishing touch to the work, we expect to find
an incomplete soldering, which would allow it to be unfastened. The method of construction deceives us: the ceiling is immovable; at
no season can my forceps manage to extract it, without destroying the
building from top to bottom. The dehiscence takes place elsewhere, at
some point on the sides.
