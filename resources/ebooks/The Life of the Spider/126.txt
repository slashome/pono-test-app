We now come to the tragic side of this confusion. Wishing to have
subjects for study within my daily reach and to save myself the trouble
of casual excursions, I collect different Epeirae whom I find in the
course of my walks and establish them on the shrubs in my enclosure. In
this way, a rosemary-hedge, sheltered from the wind and facing the sun,
is turned into a well-stocked menagerie. I take the Spiders from the
paper bags wherein I had put them separately, to carry them, and place
them on the leaves, with no further precaution. It is for them to make
themselves at home. As a rule, they do not budge all day from the place
where I put them: they wait for nightfall before seeking a suitable site
whereon to weave a net. Some among them show less patience. A little while ago, they
possessed a web, between the reeds of a brook or in the holm-oak copses;
and now they have none. They go off in search, to recover their property
or seize on some one else's: it is all the same to them. I come upon a
Banded Epeira, newly imported, making for the web of a Silky Epeira who
has been my guest for some days now. The owner is at her post, in the
centre of the net.
