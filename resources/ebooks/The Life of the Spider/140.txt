I look for better things if circumstances favour her. Toiling in the
midst of a dense thicket, among a tangle of dead leaves and twigs, she
may well produce a very inaccurate piece of work; but compel her to
labour when free from all impediment: she will then–I am convinced of it
beforehand–apply her talents without constraint and show herself an
adept in the building of graceful nests. As laying-time approaches, towards the middle of August, I instal
half-a-dozen Labyrinth Spiders in large wire-gauze cages, each standing
in an earthen pan filled with sand. A sprig of thyme, planted in the
centre, will furnish supports for the structure, together with the
trellis-work of the top and sides. There is no other furniture, no dead
leaves, which would spoil the shape of the nest if the mother were
minded to employ them as a covering. By way of provision, Locusts, every
day.
