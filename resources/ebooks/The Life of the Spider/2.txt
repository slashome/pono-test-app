These burrows are cylindrical; they are often an
inch in diameter and run into the ground to a depth of more than a foot;
but they are not perpendicular. The inhabitant of this gut proves that
she is at the same time a skilful hunter and an able engineer. It was a
question for her not only of constructing a deep retreat that could hide
her from the pursuit of her foes: she also had to set up her observatory
whence to watch for her prey and dart out upon it. The Tarantula
provides for every contingency: the underground passage, in fact, begins
by being vertical, but, at four or five inches from the surface, it
bends at an obtuse angle, forms a horizontal turning and then becomes
perpendicular once more. It is at the elbow of this tunnel that the
Tarantula posts herself as a vigilant sentry and does not for a moment
lose sight of the door of her dwelling; it was there that, at the period
when I was hunting her, I used to see those eyes gleaming like diamonds,
bright as a cat's eyes in the dark. The outer orifice of the Tarantula's burrow is usually surmounted by
a shaft constructed throughout by herself. It is a genuine work of
architecture, standing as much as an inch above the ground and sometimes
two inches in diameter, so that it is wider than the burrow itself. This
last circumstance, which seems to have been calculated by the
industrious Spider, lends itself admirably to the necessary extension of
the legs at the moment when the prey is to be seized. The shaft is
composed mainly of bits of dry wood joined by a little clay and so
artistically laid, one above the other, that they form the scaffolding
of a straight column, the inside of which is a hollow cylinder. The
solidity of this tubular building, of this outwork, is ensured above all
by the fact that it is lined, upholstered within, with a texture woven
by the Lycosa's {3} spinnerets and continued throughout the
interior of the burrow. It is easy to imagine how useful this
cleverly-manufactured lining must be for preventing landslip or warping,
for maintaining cleanliness and for helping her claws to scale the
fortress. I hinted that this outwork of the burrow was not there invariably;
as a matter of fact, I have often come across Tarantulas' holes without
a trace of it, perhaps because it had been accidentally destroyed by the
weather, or because the Lycosa may not always light upon the proper
building-materials, or, lastly, because architectural talent is possibly
declared only in individuals that have reached the final stage, the
period of perfection of their physical and intellectual development. One thing is certain, that I have had numerous opportunities of
seeing these shafts, these out-works of the Tarantula's abode; they
remind me, on a larger scale, of the tubes of certain Caddis-worms. The
Arachnid had more than one object in view in constructing them: she
shelters her retreat from the floods; she protects it from the fall of
foreign bodies which, swept by the wind, might end by obstructing it;
lastly, she uses it as a snare by offering the Flies and other insects
whereon she feeds a projecting point to settle on. Who shall tell us all
the wiles employed by this clever and daring huntress? Let us now say something about my rather diverting Tarantula-hunts. The best season for them is the months of May and June. The first time
that I lighted on this Spider's burrows and discovered that they were
inhabited by seeing her come to a point on the first floor of her
dwelling–the elbow which I have mentioned–I thought that I must attack
her by main force and pursue her relentlessly in order to capture her; I
spent whole hours in opening up the trench with a knife a foot long by
two inches wide, without meeting the Tarantula. I renewed the operation
in other burrows, always with the same want of success; I really wanted
a pickaxe to achieve my object, but I was too far from any kind of
house. I was obliged to change my plan of attack and I resorted to
craft. Necessity, they say, is the mother of invention. It occurred to me to take a stalk, topped with its spikelet, by way
of a bait, and to rub and move it gently at the orifice of the burrow. I
soon saw that the Lycosa's attention and desires were roused. Attracted
by the bait, she came with measured steps towards the spikelet. I
withdrew it in good time a little outside the hole, so as not to leave
the animal time for reflexion; and the Spider suddenly, with a rush,
darted out of her dwelling, of which I hastened to close the entrance. The Tarantula, bewildered by her unaccustomed liberty, was very awkward
in evading my attempts at capture; and I compelled her to enter a paper
bag, which I closed without delay. Sometimes, suspecting the trap, or perhaps less pressed by hunger,
she would remain coy and motionless, at a slight distance from the
threshold, which she did not think it opportune to cross. Her patience
outlasted mine. In that case, I employed the following tactics: after
making sure of the Lycosa's position and the direction of the tunnel, I
drove a knife into it on the slant, so as to take the animal in the rear
and cut off its retreat by stopping up the burrow. I seldom failed in my
attempt, especially in soil that was not stony. In these critical
circumstances, either the Tarantula took fright and deserted her lair
for the open, or else she stubbornly remained with her back to the
blade. I would then give a sudden jerk to the knife, which flung both
the earth and the Lycosa to a distance, enabling me to capture her. By
employing this hunting-method, I sometimes caught as many as fifteen
Tarantulae within the space of an hour. In a few cases, in which the Tarantula was under no misapprehension
as to the trap which I was setting for her, I was not a little
surprised, when I pushed the stalk far enough down to twist it round her
hiding-place, to see her play with the spikelet more or less
contemptuously and push it away with her legs, without troubling to
retreat to the back of her lair. The Apulian peasants, according to Baglivi's {4} account, also hunt the Tarantula by imitating
the humming of an insect with an oat-stalk at the entrance to her
burrow. I quote the passage:

RuricolÃ¦ nostri quando eas captare volunt, ad illorum latibula
accedunt, tenuisque avenacÃ¦ fistulÃ¦ sonum, apum murmuri non absimilem,
modulantur. Quo audito, ferox exit Tarentula ut muscas vel alia hujus
modi insecta, quorum murmur esse putat, captat; captatur tamen ista a
rustico insidiatore. {5}

The Tarantula, so dreadful at first sight, especially when we are
filled with the idea that her bite is dangerous, so fierce in
appearance, is nevertheless quite easy to tame, as I have often found by
experiment. On the 7th of May 1812, while at Valencia, in Spain, I caught a
fair-sized male Tarantula, without hurting him, and imprisoned him in a
glass jar, with a paper cover in which I cut a trap-door. At the bottom
of the jar I put a paper bag, to serve as his habitual residence. I
placed the jar on a table in my bedroom, so as to have him under
frequent observation. He soon grew accustomed to captivity and ended by
becoming so familiar that he would come and take from my fingers the
live Fly which I gave him. After killing his victim with the fangs of
his mandibles, he was not satisfied, like most Spiders, to suck her
head: he chewed her whole body, shoving it piecemeal into his mouth with
his palpi, after which he threw up the masticated teguments and swept
them away from his lodging. Having finished his meal, he nearly always made his toilet, which
consisted in brushing his palpi and mandibles, both inside and out, with
his front tarsi. After that, he resumed his air of motionless gravity. The evening and the night were his time for taking his walks abroad. I
often heard him scratching the paper of the bag. These habits confirm
the opinion, which I have already expressed elsewhere, that most Spiders
have the faculty of seeing by day and night, like cats. On the 28th of June, my Tarantula cast his skin. It was his last
moult and did not perceptibly alter either the colour of his attire or
the dimensions of his body. On the 14th of July, I had to leave
Valencia; and I stayed away until the 23rd. During this time, the
Tarantula fasted; I found him looking quite well on my return. On the
20th of August, I again left for a nine days' absence, which my prisoner
bore without food and without detriment to his health. On the 1st of
October, I once more deserted the Tarantula, leaving him without
provisions. On the 21st, I was fifty miles from Valencia and, as I
intended to remain there, I sent a servant to fetch him. I was sorry to
learn that he was not found in the jar, and I never heard what became of
him. I will end my observations on the Tarantulae with a short
description of a curious fight between those animals. One day, when I
had had a successful hunt after these Lycosae, I picked out two
full-grown and very powerful males and brought them together in a wide
jar, in order to enjoy the sight of a combat to the death. After walking
round the arena several times, to try and avoid each other, they were
not slow in placing themselves in a warlike attitude, as though at a
given signal. I saw them, to my surprise, take their distances and sit
up solemnly on their hind-legs, so as mutually to present the shield of
their chests to each other. After watching them face to face like that
for two minutes, during which they had doubtless provoked each other by
glances that escaped my own, I saw them fling themselves upon each other
at the same time, twisting their legs round each other and obstinately
struggling to bite each other with the fangs of the mandibles. Whether
from fatigue or from convention, the combat was suspended; there was a
few seconds' truce; and each athlete moved away and resumed his
threatening posture. This circumstance reminded me that, in the strange
fights between cats, there are also suspensions of hostilities. But the
contest was soon renewed between my two Tarantulae with increased
fierceness. One of them, after holding victory in the balance for a
while, was at last thrown and received a mortal wound in the head. He
became the prey of the conqueror, who tore open his skull and devoured
it. After this curious duel, I kept the victorious Tarantula alive for
several weeks.'

My district does not boast the ordinary Tarantula, the Spider whose
habits have been described above by the Wizard of the Landes; but it
possesses an equivalent in the shape of the Black-bellied Tarantula, or
Narbonne Lycosa, half the size of the other, clad in black velvet on the
lower surface, especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the
abdomen and grey and white rings around the legs. Her favourite home is
the dry, pebbly ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme. In my
harmas {6} laboratory there are quite twenty of this
Spider's burrows. Rarely do I pass by one of these haunts without giving
a glance down the pit where gleam, like diamonds, the four great eyes,
the four telescopes, of the hermit. The four others, which are much
smaller, are not visible at that depth. Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from
my house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a
dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from
stone to stone. The love of lucre has laid waste the land. Because wine
paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine. Then came
the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land
is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy
grasses sprout among the pebbles. This waste-land is the Lycosa's
paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred
burrows within a limited range. These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first
and then bent elbow-wise. The average diameter is an inch. On the edge
of the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts
and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut. The whole is kept in
place and cemented with silk. Often, the Spider confines herself to
drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties
down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades
from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of a
masonry constructed of small stones. The nature of the kerb is decided
by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in the close
neighbourhood of the building-yard. There is no selection: everything
meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand. Economy of time, therefore, causes the defensive wall to vary greatly
as regards its constituent elements. The height varies also. One
enclosure is a turret an inch high; another amounts to a mere rim. All
have their parts bound firmly together with silk; and all have the same
width as the subterranean channel, of which they are the extension. There is here no difference in diameter between the underground manor
and its outwork, nor do we behold, at the opening, the platform which
the turret leaves to give free play to the Italian Tarantula's legs. The
Black-bellied Tarantula's work takes the form of a well surmounted by
its kerb. When the soil is earthy and homogeneous, the architectural type is
free from obstructions and the Spider's dwelling is a cylindrical tube;
but, when the site is pebbly, the shape is modified according to the
exigencies of the digging. In the second case, the lair is often a
rough, winding cave, at intervals along whose inner wall stick blocks of
stone avoided in the process of excavation. Whether regular or
irregular, the house is plastered to a certain depth with a coat of
silk, which prevents earth-slips and facilitates scaling when a prompt
exit is required. Baglivi, in his unsophisticated Latin, teaches us how to catch the
Tarantula. I became his rusticus insidiator; I waved a spikelet
at the entrance of the burrow to imitate the humming of a Bee and
attract the attention of the Lycosa, who rushes out, thinking that she
is capturing a prey. This method did not succeed with me. The Spider, it
is true, leaves her remote apartments and comes a little way up the
vertical tube to enquire into the sounds at her door; but the wily
animal soon scents a trap; it remains motionless at mid-height and, at
the least alarm, goes down again to the branch gallery, where it is
invisible. LÃ©on Dufour's appears to me a better method if it were only
practicable in the conditions wherein I find myself. To drive a knife
quickly into the ground, across the burrow, so as to cut off the
Tarantula's retreat when she is attracted by the spikelet and standing
on the upper floor, would be a manoeuvre certain of success, if the soil
were favourable. Unfortunately, this is not so in my case: you might as
well try to dig a knife into a block of tufa. Other stratagems become necessary. Here are two which were
successful: I recommend them to future Tarantula-hunters. I insert into
the burrow, as far down as I can, a stalk with a fleshy spikelet, which
the Spider can bite into. I move and turn and twist my bait. The
Tarantula, when touched by the intruding body, contemplates self-defence
and bites the spikelet. A slight resistance informs my fingers that the
animal has fallen into the trap and seized the tip of the stalk in its
fangs. I draw it to me, slowly, carefully; the Spider hauls from below,
planting her legs against the wall. It comes, it rises. I hide as best I
may, when the Spider enters the perpendicular tunnel: if she saw me, she
would let go the bait and slip down again. I thus bring her, by degrees,
to the orifice. This is the difficult moment. If I continue the gentle
movement, the Spider, feeling herself dragged out of her home, would at
once run back indoors. It is impossible to get the suspicious animal out
by this means. Therefore, when it appears at the level of the ground, I
give a sudden pull. Surprised by this foul play, the Tarantula has no
time to release her hold; gripping the spikelet, she is thrown some
inches away from the burrow. Her capture now becomes an easy matter. Outside her own house, the Lycosa is timid, as though scared, and hardly
capable of running away. To push her with a straw into a paper bag is
the affair of a second. It requires some patience to bring the Tarantula who has bitten into
the insidious spikelet to the entrance of the burrow. The following
method is quicker: I procure a supply of live Bumble-bees. I put one
into a little bottle with a mouth just wide enough to cover the opening
of the burrow; and I turn the apparatus thus baited over the said
opening. The powerful Bee at first flutters and hums about her glass
prison; then, perceiving a burrow similar to that of her family, she
enters it without much hesitation. She is extremely ill-advised: while
she goes down, the Spider comes up; and the meeting takes place in the
perpendicular passage. For a few moments, the ear perceives a sort of
death-song: it is the humming of the Bumble-bee, protesting against the
reception given her. This is followed by a long silence. Then I remove
the bottle and dip a long-jawed forceps into the pit. I withdraw the
Bumble-bee, motionless, dead, with hanging proboscis. A terrible tragedy
must have happened. The Spider follows, refusing to let go so rich a
booty. Game and huntress are brought to the orifice. Sometimes,
mistrustful, the Lycosa goes in again; but we have only to leave the
Bumble-bee on the threshold of the door, or even a few inches away, to
see her reappear, issue from her fortress and daringly recapture her
prey. This is the moment: the house is closed with the finger, or a
pebble and, as Baglivi says, captatur tamen ista a rustico
insidiatore,' to which I will add, adjuvante Bombo.'

The object of these hunting methods was not exactly to obtain
Tarantulae; I had not the least wish to rear the Spider in a bottle. I
was interested in a different matter.
