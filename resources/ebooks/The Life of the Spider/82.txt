The Epeira's eye, more
experienced in matters of this sort than mine, has recognized the
general lie of the land; and the rope-fabric has been erected
accordingly: it is very inaccurate in my opinion, but very suitable for
the Spider's designs. What is it that she really wants? A solid frame to
contain the network of the web. The shapeless structure which she has
just built fulfils the desired conditions: it marks out a flat, free and
perpendicular area. This is all that is necessary. The whole work, for that matter, is now soon completed; it is done
all over again, each evening, from top to bottom, for the incidents of
the chase destroy it in a night. The net is as yet too delicate to
resist the desperate struggles of the captured prey. On the other hand,
the adults' net, which is formed of stouter threads, is adapted to last
some time; and the Epeira gives it a more carefully-constructed
framework, as we shall see elsewhere. A special thread, the foundation of the real net, is stretched across
the area so capriciously circumscribed. It is distinguished from the
others by its isolation, its position at a distance from any twig that
might interfere with its swaying length.
