On this subject I have
but one document, a pretty far-reaching one, however. There were a few
mothers whose actions I had the patience to watch, despite the wearisome
minutiae of the rearing and the slowness of the result. These abandoned
their dwellings after the departure of their young; and each went to
weave a new one for herself on the wire net-work of the cage. They were rough-and-ready summaries, the work of a night. Two
hangings, one above the other, the upper one flat, the lower concave and
ballasted with stalactites of grains of sand, formed the new home,
which, strengthened daily by fresh layers, promised to become similar to
the old one. Why does the Spider desert her former mansion, which is in
no way dilapidated–far from it–and still exceedingly serviceable, as far
as one can judge? Unless I am mistaken, I think I have an inkling of the
reason.
