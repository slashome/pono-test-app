It is
these whom we sometimes meet wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag
behind them. Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and the
month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow will
bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her. I am able to
procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain
experiments of the highest interest. It is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure
after her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and
defending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe. If I try
to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair, hangs
on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.
