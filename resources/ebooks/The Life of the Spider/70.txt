A current of lukewarm air, coming from the chafing-dish,
escapes through the top. Dandelion-plumes, taking that direction, tell
me so. The wafting threads cannot fail to be carried by this flow of air
and to lengthen out in the open, where a light breeze is blowing. I take a pair of sharp scissors and, without shaking the threads, cut
a few that are just visible at the base, where they are thickened with
an added strand.
