Here, thought I, is an ardent
huntress, living solely by her trade. She does not prepare preserved
foodstuffs for her offspring; {8} she herself feeds on the prey which she
catches. She is not a Â˜paralyzer,' {9} who cleverly spares her quarry so as to leave
it a glimmer of life and keep it fresh for weeks at a time; she is a
killer, who makes a meal off her capture on the spot. With her, there is
no methodical vivisection, which destroys movement without entirely
destroying life, but absolute death, as sudden as possible, which
protects the assailant from the counter-attacks of the assailed. Her game, moreover, is essentially bulky and not always of the most
peaceful character. This Diana, ambushed in her tower, needs a prey
worthy of her prowess. The big Grasshopper, with the powerful jaws; the
irascible Wasp; the Bee, the Bumble-bee and other wearers of poisoned
daggers must fall into the ambuscade from time to time. The duel is
nearly equal in point of weapons. To the venomous fangs of the Lycosa
the Wasp opposes her venomous stiletto. Which of the two bandits shall
have the best of it? The struggle is a hand-to-hand one. The Tarantula
has no secondary means of defence, no cord to bind her victim, no trap
to subdue her. When the Epeira, or Garden Spider, sees an insect
entangled in her great upright web, she hastens up and covers the
captive with corded meshes and silk ribbons by the armful, making all
resistance impossible. When the prey is solidly bound, a prick is
carefully administered with the poison-fangs; then the Spider retires,
waiting for the death-throes to calm down, after which the huntress
comes back to the game. In these conditions, there is no serious
danger. In the case of the Lycosa, the job is riskier. She has naught to
serve her but her courage and her fangs and is obliged to leap upon the
formidable prey, to master it by her dexterity, to annihilate it, in a
measure, by her swift-slaying talent. Annihilate is the word: the Bumble-bees whom I draw from the fatal
hole are a sufficient proof. As soon as that shrill buzzing, which I
called the death-song, ceases, in vain I hasten to insert my forceps: I
always bring out the insect dead, with slack proboscis and limp legs. Scarce a few quivers of those legs tell me that it is a quite recent
corpse. The Bumble-bee's death is instantaneous. Each time that I take a
fresh victim from the terrible slaughter-house, my surprise is renewed
at the sight of its sudden immobility. Nevertheless, both animals have very nearly the same strength; for I
choose my Bumble-bees from among the largest (Bombus hortorum
and B. terrestris). Their weapons are almost equal: the Bee's
dart can bear comparison with the Spider's fangs; the sting of the first
seems to me as formidable as the bite of the second. How comes it that
the Tarantula always has the upper hand and this moreover in a very
short conflict, whence she emerges unscathed? There must certainly be
some cunning strategy on her part. Subtle though her poison may be, I
cannot believe that its mere injection, at any point whatever of the
victim, is enough to produce so prompt a catastrophe. The ill-famed
rattlesnake does not kill so quickly, takes hours to achieve that for
which the Tarantula does not require a second. We must, therefore, look
for an explanation of this sudden death to the vital importance of the
point attacked by the Spider, rather than to the virulence of the
poison. What is this point? It is impossible to recognize it on the
Bumble-bees. They enter the burrow; and the murder is committed far from
sight. Nor does the lens discover any wound upon the corpse, so delicate
are the weapons that produce it. One would have to see the two
adversaries engage in a direct contest.
