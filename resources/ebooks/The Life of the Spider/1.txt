THE LIFE OF
THE SPIDER

CHAPTER I:
THE BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA

The Spider has a bad name: to most of us, she represents an odious,
noxious animal, which every one hastens to crush under foot. Against
this summary verdict the observer sets the beast's industry, its talent
as a weaver, its wiliness in the chase, its tragic nuptials and other
characteristics of great interest. Yes, the Spider is well worth
studying, apart from any scientific reasons; but she is said to be
poisonous and that is her crime and the primary cause of the repugnance
wherewith she inspires us. Poisonous, I agree, if by that we understand
that the animal is armed with two fangs which cause the immediate death
of the little victims which it catches; but there is a wide difference
between killing a Midge and harming a man. However immediate in its
effects upon the insect entangled in the fatal web, the Spider's poison
is not serious for us and causes less inconvenience than a Gnat-bite. That, at least, is what we can safely say as regards the great majority
of the Spiders of our regions. Nevertheless, a few are to be feared; and foremost among these is the
Malmignatte, the terror of the Corsican peasantry. I have seen her
settle in the furrows, lay out her web and rush boldly at insects larger
than herself; I have admired her garb of black velvet speckled with
carmine-red; above all, I have heard most disquieting stories told about
her. Around Ajaccio and Bonifacio, her bite is reputed very dangerous,
sometimes mortal. The countryman declares this for a fact and the doctor
does not always dare deny it. In the neighbourhood of Pujaud, not far
from Avignon, the harvesters speak with dread of Theridion
lugubre, {1} first observed by LÃ©on Dufour in the
Catalonian mountains; according to them, her bite would lead to serious
accidents. The Italians have bestowed a bad reputation on the Tarantula,
who produces convulsions and frenzied dances in the person stung by her. To cope with tarantism,' the name given to the disease that follows on
the bite of the Italian Spider, you must have recourse to music, the
only efficacious remedy, so they tell us. Special tunes have been noted,
those quickest to afford relief. There is medical choreography, medical
music. And have we not the tarantella, a lively and nimble dance,
bequeathed to us perhaps by the healing art of the Calabrian
peasant? Must we take these queer things seriously or laugh at them? From the
little that I have seen, I hesitate to pronounce an opinion. Nothing
tells us that the bite of the Tarantula may not provoke, in weak and
very impressionable people, a nervous disorder which music will relieve;
nothing tells us that a profuse perspiration, resulting from a very
energetic dance, is not likely to diminish the discomfort by diminishing
the cause of the ailment. So far from laughing, I reflect and enquire,
when the Calabrian peasant talks to me of his Tarantula, the Pujaud
reaper of his Theridion lugubre, the Corsican husbandman of his
Malmignatte. Those Spiders might easily deserve, at least partly, their
terrible reputation. The most powerful Spider in my district, the Black-bellied Tarantula,
will presently give us something to think about, in this connection. It
is not my business to discuss a medical point, I interest myself
especially in matters of instinct; but, as the poison-fangs play a
leading part in the huntress' manoeuvres of war, I shall speak of their
effects by the way. The habits of the Tarantula, her ambushes, her
artifices, her methods of killing her prey: these constitute my subject. I will preface it with an account by LÃ©on Dufour, {2} one of those accounts in which I used to
delight and which did much to bring me into closer touch with the
insect. The Wizard of the Landes tells us of the ordinary Tarantula,
that of the Calabrias, observed by him in Spain:

Lycosa tarantula by preference inhabits open places, dry,
arid, uncultivated places, exposed to the sun. She lives generally–at
least when full-grown–in underground passages, regular burrows, which
she digs for herself.
