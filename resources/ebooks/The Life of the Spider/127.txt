She awaits the stranger with seeming impassiveness. Then suddenly they grip each other; and a desperate fight begins. The
Silky Epeira is worsted. The other swathes her in bonds, drags her to
the non-limy central floor and, in the calmest fashion, eats her. The
dead Spider is munched for twenty-four hours and drained to the last
drop, when the corpse, a wretched, crumpled ball, is at last flung
aside. The web so foully conquered becomes the property of the stranger,
who uses it, if it have not suffered too much in the contest. There is here a shadow of an excuse. The two Spiders were of
different species; and the struggle for life often leads to these
exterminations among such as are not akin. What would happen if the two
belonged to the same species?
