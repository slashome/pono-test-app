The result of this operation is marvellous. Hanging to
the flying-rope, which is borne on the wind outside, the Spider passes
through the window, suddenly flies off and disappears. An easy way of
travelling, if the conveyance possessed a rudder that allowed the
passenger to land where he pleases! But the little things are at the
mercy of the winds: where will they alight? Hundreds, thousands of yards
away, perhaps.
