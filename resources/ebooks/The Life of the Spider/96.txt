Let us devise something
better. Next day, the web is renewed, after the old one has been swallowed. When the work is done and the Epeira seated motionless at her central
post, I take a straw and, wielding it dexterously, so as to respect the
resting-floor and the spokes, I pull and root up the spiral, which
dangles in tatters. With its snaring-threads ruined, the net is useless;
no passing Moth would allow herself to be caught. Now what does the
Epeira do in the face of this disaster? Nothing at all. Motionless on
her resting-floor, which I have left intact, she awaits the capture of
the game; she awaits it all night in vain on her impotent web. In the
morning, I find the snare as I left it. Necessity, the mother of
invention, has not prompted the Spider to make a slight repair in her
ruined toils. Possibly this is asking too much of her resources. The silk-glands
may be exhausted after the laying of the great spiral; and to repeat the
same expenditure immediately is out of the question. I want a case
wherein there could be no appeal to any such exhaustion.
