Rest causes commotion. When calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly
pondering the harsh problem of life:

Shall I dine to-day, or not?'

Certain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in
abundance and need not struggle to obtain it. Such is the Gentle, who
swims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying adder. Others–and, by a
strange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted–only manage
to eat by dint of craft and patience. You are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae! So that you may
dine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without
result. I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you
about my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for
catching ideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the Moth. Let us not lose heart. The best part of life is not in the present,
still less in the past; it lies in the future, the domain of hope. Let
us wait.
