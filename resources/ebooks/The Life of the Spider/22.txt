I find it, when I visit the
cage in the morning, hanging from the trellis-work and completed. It is
perfect, as regards structure; it is decorated with the regulation black
meridian curves. There is nothing missing, nothing except the essential
thing, the eggs, for which the spinstress has gone to such expense in
the matter of silks. Where are the eggs?
