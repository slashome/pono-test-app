What luxury! We are
taught how a Sybarite of old was unable to rest, owing to the presence
of a crumpled rose-leaf in his bed. The Clotho is quite as fastidious. Her couch is more delicate than swan's-down and whiter than the fleece
of the clouds where brood the summer storms. It is the ideal blanket. Above is a canopy or tester of equal softness. Between the two nestles
the Spider, short-legged, clad in sombre garments, with five yellow
favours on her back. Rest in this exquisite retreat demands perfect stability, especially
on gusty days, when sharp draughts penetrate beneath the stone. This
condition is admirably fulfilled.
