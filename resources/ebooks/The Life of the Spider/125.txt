perturbation, they remain, plant themselves in the centre and await the
coming of the game, as though nothing extraordinary had happened. They

weave another in their own style. The Spider, therefore, is incapable of
recognizing her web. She takes another's work for hers, even when it is
produced by a stranger to her race.
