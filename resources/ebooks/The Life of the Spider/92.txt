I pick up the
floating loop with a straw and lay it on a branch, at a convenient
height. The foot-bridge erected with my assistance is considered
satisfactory, just as though the wind had placed it. I count this
collaboration among the good actions standing to my credit. Feeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from
end to end, adding a fibre to it on each journey. Whether I help or not,
this forms the suspension-cable,' the main piece of the framework. I
call it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its
structure. It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it
is seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent
parts, which are the product of as many crossings. These diverging
fibres, with their several contact-points, increase the steadiness of
the two extremities. The suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the
work and lasts for an indefinite time. The web is generally shattered
after the night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following
evening. After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,
on the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the
new network is to hang. The laying of this cable is a somewhat difficult matter, because the
success of the enterprise does not depend upon the animal's industry
alone. It has to wait until a breeze carries the line to the pier-head
in the bushes. Sometimes, a calm prevails; sometimes, the thread catches
at an unsuitable point. This involves great expenditure of time, with no
certainty of success. And so, when once the suspension-cable is in
being, well and solidly placed, the Epeira does not change it, except on
critical occasions. Every evening, she passes and repasses over it,
strengthening it with fresh threads. When the Epeira cannot manage a fall of sufficient depth to give her
the double line with its loop to be fixed at a distance, she employs
another method. She lets herself down and then climbs up again, as we
have already seen; but, this time, the thread ends suddenly in a filmy
hair-pencil, a tuft, whose parts remain disjoined, just as they come
from the spinneret's rose. Then this sort of bushy fox's brush is cut
short, as though with a pair of scissors, and the whole thread, when
unfurled, doubles its length, which is now enough for the purpose. It is
fastened by the end joined to the Spider; the other floats in the air,
with its spreading tuft, which easily tangles in the bushes. Even so
must the Banded Epeira go to work when she throws her daring
suspension-bridge across a stream. Once the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in
possession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the
leafy piers at will. From the height of the cable, the upper boundary of
the projected works, she lets herself slip to a slight depth, varying
the points of her fall. She climbs up again by the line produced by her
descent. The result of the operation is a double thread which is unwound
while the Spider walks along her big foot-bridge to the contact-branch,
where she fixes the free end of her thread more or less low down. In
this way, she obtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars,
connecting the cable with the branches. These cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever-changing
directions. When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer
resort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord
to the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs and placing her
produce in position as she goes. This results in a combination of
straight lines owning no order, save that they are kept in one, nearly
perpendicular plane. They mark a very irregular polygonal area, wherein
the web, itself a work of magnificent regularity, shall presently be
woven. It is unnecessary to go over the construction of the masterpiece
again; the younger Spiders have taught us enough in this respect. In
both cases, we see the same equidistant radii laid, with a central
landmark for a guide; the same auxiliary spiral, the scaffolding of
temporary rungs, soon doomed to disappear; the same snaring-spiral, with
its maze of closely-woven coils. Let us pass on: other details call for
our attention. The laying of the snaring-spiral is an exceedingly delicate
operation, because of the regularity of the work. I was bent upon
knowing whether, if subjected to the din of unaccustomed sounds, the
Spider would hesitate and blunder. Does she work imperturbably? Or does
she need undisturbed quiet? As it is, I know that my presence and that
of my light hardly trouble her at all. The sudden flashes emitted by my
lantern have no power to distract her from her task. She continues to
turn in the light even as she turned in the dark, neither faster nor
slower. This is a good omen for the experiment which I have in view. The first Sunday in August is the feast of the patron saint of the
village, commemorating the Finding of St. Stephen. This is Tuesday, the
third day of the rejoicings. There will be fireworks to-night, at nine
o'clock, to conclude the merry-makings. They will take place on the
high-road outside my door, at a few steps from the spot where my Spider
is working. The spinstress is busy upon her great spiral at the very
moment when the village big-wigs arrive with trumpet and drum and small
boys carrying torches. More interested in animal psychology than in pyrotechnical displays,
I watch the Epeira's doings, lantern in hand. The hullabaloo of the
crowd, the reports of the mortars, the crackle of Roman candles bursting
in the sky, the hiss of the rockets, the rain of sparks, the sudden
flashes of white, red or blue light: none of this disturbs the worker,
who methodically turns and turns again, just as she does in the peace of
ordinary evenings. Once before, the gun which I fired under the plane-trees failed to
trouble the concert of the Cicadae; to-day, the dazzling light of the
fire-wheels and the splutter of the crackers do not avail to distract
the Spider from her weaving. And, after all, what difference would it
make to my neighbour if the world fell in! The village could be blown up
with dynamite, without her losing her head for such a trifle. She would
calmly go on with her web. Let us return to the Spider manufacturing her net under the usual
tranquil conditions. The great spiral has been finished, abruptly, on
the confines of the resting-floor. The central cushion, a mat of ends of
saved thread, is next pulled up and eaten. But, before indulging in this
mouthful, which closes the proceedings, two Spiders, the only two of the
order, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, have still to sign their work. A
broad, white ribbon is laid, in a thick zigzag, from the centre to the
lower edge of the orb. Sometimes, but not always, a second band of the
same shape and of lesser length occupies the upper portion, opposite the
first. I like to look upon these odd flourishes as consolidating-gear. To
begin with, the young Epeirae never use them. For the moment, heedless
of the future and lavish of their silk, they remake their web nightly,
even though it be none too much dilapidated and might well serve again. A brand-new snare at sunset is the rule with them. And there is little
need for increased solidity when the work has to be done again on the
morrow. On the other hand, in the late autumn, the full-grown Spiders,
feeling laying-time at hand, are driven to practise economy, in view of
the great expenditure of silk required for the egg-bag. Owing to its
large size, the net now becomes a costly work which it were well to use
as long as possible, for fear of finding one's reserves exhausted when
the time comes for the expensive construction of the nest. For this
reason, or for others which escape me, the Banded and the Silky Epeirae
think it wise to produce durable work and to strengthen their toils with
a cross-ribbon. The other Epeirae, who are put to less expense in the
fabrication of their maternal wallet–a mere pill–are unacquainted with
the zigzag binder and, like the younger Spiders, reconstruct their web
almost nightly. My fat neighbour, the Angular Epeira, consulted by the light of a
lantern, shall tell us how the renewal of the net proceeds. As the
twilight fades, she comes down cautiously from her day-dwelling; she
leaves the foliage of the cypresses for the suspension-cable of her
snare. Here she stands for some time; then, descending to her web, she
collects the wreckage in great armfuls. Everything–spiral, spokes and
frame–is raked up with her legs. One thing alone is spared and that is
the suspension-cable, the sturdy piece of work that has served as a
foundation for the previous buildings and will serve for the new after
receiving a few strengthening repairs. The collected ruins form a pill which the Spider consumes with the
same greed that she would show in swallowing her prey. Nothing remains. This is the second instance of the Spiders' supreme economy of their
silk. We have seen them, after the manufacture of the net, eating the
central guide-post, a modest mouthful; we now see them gobbling up the
whole web, a meal. Refined and turned into fluid by the stomach, the
materials of the old net will serve for other purposes. As goon as the site is thoroughly cleared, the work of the frame and
the net begins on the support of the suspension-cable which was
respected. Would it not be simpler to restore the old web, which might
serve many times yet, if a few rents were just repaired? One would say
so; but does the Spider know how to patch her work, as a thrifty
housewife darns her linen? That is the question. To mend severed meshes, to replace broken threads, to adjust the new
to the old, in short, to restore the original order by assembling the
wreckage would be a far-reaching feat of prowess, a very fine proof of
gleams of intelligence, capable of performing rational calculations. Our
menders excel in this class of work.
