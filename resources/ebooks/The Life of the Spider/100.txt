At some distance from the
net, they have a rough and ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made
of a few leaves held together by stretched threads. It is here that, for
the most part, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in
meditation. But the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields. At
such times, the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the
Dragon-fly. Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during the
night, is still in serviceable condition. If some giddy-pate allow
himself to be caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has
retired, be unable to take advantage of the windfall? Never fear.
