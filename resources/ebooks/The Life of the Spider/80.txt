We
shall find her again in spring, grown quite large and crouching among
the flowers whence the Bee takes toll. CHAPTER IX:
THE GARDEN SPIDERS: BUILDING THE WEB

The fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies. With lines,
pegs and poles, two large, earth-coloured nets are stretched upon the
ground, one to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface. A
long cord, pulled, at the right moment, by the fowler, who hides in a
brushwood hut, works them and brings them together suddenly, like a pair
of shutters. Divided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds–Linnets
and Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and
Ortolans–sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant passage
of a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling note. One
of them, the SambÃ©, an irresistible tempter, hops about and
flaps his wings in apparent freedom. A bit of twine fastens him to his
convict's stake. When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his
vain attempts to get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to do
his duty, the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from his
hut. A long string sets in motion a little lever working on a pivot. Raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird flies,
falls down and flies up again at each jerk of the cord. The fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning. Suddenly, great excitement in the cages. The Chaffinches chirp their
rallying-cry:

Pinck! Pinck!'

There is something happening in the sky. The SambÃ©, quick! They are coming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous
floor. With a rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string. The
nets close and the whole flock is caught. Man has wild beast's blood in his veins. The fowler hastens to the
slaughter. With his thumb, he stifles the beating of the captives'
hearts, staves in their skulls. The little birds, so many piteous heads
of game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through
their nostrils. For scoundrelly ingenuity the Epeira's net can bear comparison with
the fowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main
features of its supreme perfection stand revealed. What refinement of
art for a mess of Flies! Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the
need to eat inspired a more cunning industry. If the reader will
meditate upon the description that follows, he will certainly share my
admiration. First of all, we must witness the making of the net; we must see it
constructed and see it again and again, for the plan of such a complex
work can only be grasped in fragments. To-day, observation will give us
one detail; to-morrow, it will give us a second, suggesting fresh points
of view; as our visits multiply, a new fact is each time added to the
sum total of the acquired data, confirming those which come before or
directing our thoughts along unsuspected paths. The snow-ball rolling over the carpet of white grows enormous,
however scanty each fresh layer be. Even so with truth in observational
science: it is built up of trifles patiently gathered together. And,
while the collecting of these trifles means that the student of Spider
industry must not be chary of his time, at least it involves no distant
and speculative research. The smallest garden contains Epeirae, all
accomplished weavers. I am able, at the proper hours, all through the fine season, to
question them, to watch them at work, now this one, anon that, according
to the chances of the day. What I did not see very plainly yesterday I
can see the next day, under better conditions, and on any of the
following days, until the phenomenon under observation is revealed in
all clearness. Let us go every evening, step by step, from one border of tall
rosemaries to the next. Should things move too slowly, we will sit down
at the foot of the shrubs, opposite the rope-yard, where the light falls
favourably, and watch with unwearying attention. Each trip will be good
for a fact that fills some gap in the ideas already gathered. To appoint
one's self, in this way, an inspector of Spiders' webs, for many years
in succession and for long seasons, means joining a not overcrowded
profession, I admit. Heaven knows, it does not enable one to put money
by! No matter: the meditative mind returns from that school fully
satisfied. To describe the separate progress of the work in the case of each of
the six Epeirae mentioned would be a useless repetition: all six employ
the same methods and weave similar webs, save for certain details that
shall be set forth later. I will, therefore, sum up in the aggregate the
particulars supplied by one or other of them. My subjects, in the first instance, are young and boast but a slight
corporation, very far removed from what it will be in the late autumn. The belly, the wallet containing the rope-works, hardly exceeds a
peppercorn in bulk. This slenderness on the part of the spinstresses
must not prejudice us against their work: there is no parity between
their skill and their years. The adult Spiders, with their disgraceful
paunches, can do no better. Moreover, the beginners have one very precious advantage for the
observer: they work by day, work even in the sun, whereas the old ones
weave only at night, at unseasonable hours.
