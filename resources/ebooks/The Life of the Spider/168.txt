It is the shape taken by a
flexible cord when held at each end and relaxed; it is the line that
governs the shape of a sail bellying in the wind; it is the curve of the
nanny-goat's milk-bag when she returns from filling her trailing udder. And all this answers to the number e. What a quantity of abstruse science for a bit of string! Let us not
be surprised. A pellet of shot swinging at the end of a thread, a drop
of dew trickling down a straw, a splash of water rippling under the
kisses of the air, a mere trifle, after all, requires a titanic
scaffolding when we wish to examine it with the eye of calculation. We
need the club of Hercules to crush a fly. Our methods of mathematical investigation are certainly ingenious; we
cannot too much admire the mighty brains that have invented them; but
how slow and laborious they appear when compared with the smallest
actualities! Will it never be given to us to probe reality in a simpler
fashion? Will our intelligence be able one day to dispense with the
heavy arsenal of formulae? Why not? Here we have the abracadabric number e reappearing,
inscribed on a Spider's thread. Let us examine, on a misty morning, the
meshwork that has been constructed during the night. Owing to their
hygrometrical nature, the sticky threads are laden with tiny drops, and,
bending under the burden, have become so many catenaries, so many
chaplets of limpid gems, graceful chaplets arranged in exquisite order
and following the curve of a swing. If the sun pierce the mist, the
whole lights up with iridescent fires and becomes a resplendent cluster
of diamonds. The number e is in its glory. Geometry, that is to say, the science of harmony in space, presides
over everything. We find it in the arrangement of the scales of a
fir-cone, as in the arrangement of an Epeira's limy web; we find it in
the spiral of a Snail-shell, in the chaplet of a Spider's thread, as in
the orbit of a planet; it is everywhere, as perfect in the world of
atoms as in the world of immensities. And this universal geometry tells us of an Universal Geometrician,
whose divine compass has measured all things. I prefer that, as an
explanation of the logarithmic curve of the Ammonite and the Epeira, to
the Worm screwing up the tip of its tail. It may not perhaps be in
accordance with latter-day teaching, but it takes a loftier flight. FOOTNOTES

date than the present chapter.–Translator's Note.
