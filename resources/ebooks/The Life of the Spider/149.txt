Would we make her acquaintance? On the rocky slopes in the oliveland,
scorched and blistered by the sun, turn over the flat stones, those of a
fair size; search, above all, the piles which the shepherds set up for a
seat whence to watch the sheep browsing amongst the lavender below. Do
not be too easily disheartened: the Clotho is rare; not every spot suits
her. If fortune smile at last upon our perseverance, we shall see,
clinging to the lower surface of the stone which we have lifted, an
edifice of a weather-beaten aspect, shaped like an over-turned cupola
and about the size of half a tangerine orange. The outside is encrusted
or hung with small shells, particles of earth and, especially, dried
insects. The edge of the cupola is scalloped into a dozen angular lobes, the
points of which spread and are fixed to the stone. In between these
straps is the same number of spacious inverted arches. The whole
represents the Ishmaelite's camel-hair tent, but upside down. A flat
roof, stretched between the straps, closes the top of the dwelling. Then where is the entrance? All the arches of the edge open upon the
roof; not one leads to the interior. The eye seeks in vain; there is
nothing to point to a passage between the inside and the outside. Yet
the owner of the house must go out from time to time, were it only in
search of food; on returning from her expedition, she must go in again. How does she make her exits and her entrances? A straw will tell us the
secret. Pass it over the threshold of the various arches.
