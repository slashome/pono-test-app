under an evil star, a circumstance which must be reckoned to the account
of the Greeks and Romans, whose humour it was to treat it as a sort of
Don Quixote of animals. Its liability to be flogged has always increased
with its celebrity, which, no one can deny, is great and indefeasible. The poor ass has paid very dear, and continues to pay still dearer, upon
earth for
the flight which the fantasy of primeval men made it take in the
mythical heavens. May this chapter–if it produce no other effect–have at
least that of sparing the poor calumniated animal some few of the many
blows which, given in fun, it is accustomed to receive, as if to afford
a vent for the satirical humour of our race, and ad exhilarandam
caveam. The germ of the reputation the ass has of being both a stupid and a
petulant animal, acquired in Greece and in Italy, spreading thence into
all the other parts of Europe, may already be found in the ancient myths
of the Hindoos. Professor Weber,[686] however, has proved, in answer to
Herr Wagener, that the idea of a stupid and presumptuous ass, such as we
always find it represented in the fables of the PaÅÄatantram,
was diffused in India by the Greeks, and is not indigenous to Hindoo
faith and literature. dearly pays the penalty of the honours conceded to his illustrious
mythical ancestors of the East. We think that the ass of which we hear
heroic achievements related is the same as that which now humbly carries
the pack; and since we no longer regard him as capable of a magnanimous
action, we suppose that he (unfortunate animal!) appropriates to himself
all these ancient glories out of vain presumption, for which reason
there is no affront which we do not feel entitled to offer to him. Nor
did Christianity succeed in delivering him from
persecution,–Christianity, which, as it represents the Sun of nations,
the Redeemer of the world, as born between the two musical animals, the
ox and the ass (who were to prevent His cries from being heard), and
introduces the ass as the saviour of the Divine Child persecuted during
the night, and as the animal ridden by Christ, in his last entry into
Jerusalem, invested him with more than one sacred title which ought from
its devotees to have procured for him a little more regard. Unfortunately, the same famous mediÃ¦val ecclesiastical hymn which was
sung in France on the 14th of January in honour of the ass, richly
caparisoned near the altar, to celebrate the flight into Egypt, was
turned into a satire. It must have been not without some gay levity that
priest and people exclaimed "Hinham!" three times after the conclusion
of the mass, on the day of the festival of the ass. [687] Nor

did
the inhabitants of Empoli show him more reverence, when, on the eighth
day after the festival of the

[688] On Christmas Day, in the Carnival,
on Palm-Sunday, and in the processions which follow the festival of

[689]

the
Church often introduced the ass into her ceremonies, but more in order
to exhilarate the minds of her devotees than to edify them by any
suggestion of the virtues it represents in the Gospels; so that,
notwithstanding the great services rendered by the ass to the Founder of
the new religion, he not only received no benefit in return from
Christianity, but became instead the unfortunate object of new
attentions, which rather depressed than heightened his already
sufficiently degraded social condition. And so the Greeks and Romans first, and the Catholic priests
afterwards, combined, by their treatment of him, to make the ass more
indifferent than he would otherwise have been to the passion and
spirited struggle for life shown in all the other animals. He was
perhaps intended for a higher fate, if man had not come upon earth, and
interfered too persistently to thwart his vocation. And probably his
race gradually deteriorated, just because, having become ridiculous, few
cared to preserve or increase his nobleness. As the proverb said that it
was useless to wash the ass's head, so it seemed useless for man to
endeavour to ameliorate or civilise his form: the physical
decadence of the ass was contemporary and parallel with his decline
morally. But although it was in Greece and Rome that the poor ass was thrown
completely down from his rank in the animal kingdom, the first decree of
his fall was pronounced in his ancient Asiatic abode. Let us prove
this. In the á¹igvedas, the ass already appears under two different
aspects–one divine and the other demoniacal–to which may perhaps be
added a third intermediate or gandharvic aspect. In the á¹igvedas, the ass has the names of gardabhas
and rÃ¢sabhas; in Sanská¹it, also those of kharas, ÄakrÃ®vant,
Äiramehin, and bÃ¢leyas. It is important to notice how each of these designations tends to
lapse into ambiguity; and ambiguity in words plays a considerable part
in the formation of myths and popular beliefs. Let us begin with the most modern designations. [690]), as well as the demoniacal (from

Äiramehin is the ass as longe mingens (a quality
which can apply to the ass, but still more so to the rainy cloud). ÄakrÃ®vant means he who is furnished with wheels, with round
objects or testicles (an epithet equally applicable to the ass and his
phallos). [691] to resound, to bellow; but I think
I can recognise in the word

[692] that is, he who walks in the
unguent, or he who goes in the perfume) helps me to understand the
proverb, "Asinus in unguento," and the corresponding legends. The
equivocal word

plant. [694] The mythical ass and the Vedic

[695] so much so that for a woman's sake
they allow themselves to be deprived of the ambrosia (or somas); and it
is also known from the story of UrvaÃ§Ã® how jealous they are of their
nymphs, the

and
waters. [696] The mythical and legendary ass
also has a foible for beautiful maidens; it is unnecessary to give the
reason of this belief. [697] When Circe wishes to give, by
means of an unguent, an ass's head to Odysseus, we find an allusion to
the loves of the ass and the beautiful woman. When the Lucius of
Apuleius, while endeavouring to change himself into a bird (another of
the names by which the phallos is indicated), becomes instead, by means
of the woman's unguent, an ass, the ass is another name for the
phallical bird. And as the Vedic ass delights in the

he
carries the priapÅ“an mysteries, whence the expression of Aristophanes in
the

[698] in the story of Perrault, it is
the beautiful maiden, the evening aurora, the girl persecuted by her
father and would-be seducer, who disguises herself during the night with
an ass's skin;

[699] the beautiful girl evidently
transfers her erotic sympathies to the ass that loves her. Of loves such
as these,–of an ass with a maiden, or of the young hero and an ass,–are
born the monstrous onokentaurs and Empusa, now a beautiful maiden, and
now the terrifier of children, who is represented with ass's feet,
because her mother was an ass, and her father, Aristoxenes, enamoured of
an ass. It is now the evening aurora, now the dying sun, and now both,
who, under the cloud of night, or in winter, are represented as covered
with an ass's skin. Professor Kuhn has already proved the close
affinity, amounting to identity, between the gandharvÃ¢s and the Hellenic
kentauroi, both of which come before us in connection with the
inebriating drink; but the kentauros is essentially a hippokentauros,

or,
still better, an onokentauros,

[700] or centaur ass. The fable of Cupid
and Psyche in Apuleius, in its relation

with
the story of the ass, perfectly agrees with the analogous Hindoo fable
of the loves of PurÃ»ravas and UrvaÃ§Ã®, united with the story of the
GandharvÃ¢s. Peau d'Ã¢ne, Psyche, and UrvaÃ§Ã® are therefore mythical
sisters. Professor Kuhn's proof of the identity of the gandharvas and the
kentauros being admitted, the identity of the gardabhas with the
gandharbas, and of the ass with the gandharvas, seems to follow as a
natural consequence. The myth of the kentauros, either hippokentauros or
onokentauros, no less than the myth of the gandharvas, corresponds
entirely with that of the ass. The kentauros loves wine and women; he
plays the lyre upon the car of Dionysos in conjunction with satyrs,
nymphs, and bacchantes; he teaches on Mount Pelion music,[701] the science of health, and the
prophetic art to the Dioscuri, which are all subjects that occur again
with slight modifications in the Hindoo legends concerning the
gandharvÃ¢s, and in the fable of the ass, as we shall prove
hereafter.–But to return to the Hindoo myth; in the same way as the
gandharvÃ¢s has a hybrid nature, and shows himself at one time in the
aspect of a demi-god, at another in that of a semi-demon, so the
mythical ass of
India has now a divine nature, and now a human. The gandharvas is the
guardian of riches and waters: inasmuch as he defends them from the
demoniacal robbers, preserves them from mortals, and distributes them
among the pious, he appears under a beneficent and divine aspect;
inasmuch, on the other hand, as he carries them off and keeps them shut
up like a miser, he resembles the monster that is fabled to guard
fountains and treasures, the demon who keeps the waters shut up, the
thieves who gather treasures together, and the devil, the master of all
riches. For the same reason we already find in Hindoo tradition the
beneficent ass and his evil-doing congener. The sun (sometimes the moon
also) in the cloud and the darkness of night is the same as the treasure
in the cavern, the treasure in hell, and the hero or heroine in the
gloomy forest; and this cavern and hell sometimes assume the form of an
ass's skin, or of an ass simply. That which comes out of the cloud, and
of the gloom, also comes out of the ass; the soul of the ass is the sun,
or the hero or heroine, or the riches which he conceals. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u are
often found in connection with the worthless horse, which afterwards
becomes handsome by means of the ambrosia itself that the horse
produces; the gandharvÃ¢s, a more nocturnal and cloudy form, if I may use
the expression, of the solar or lunar hero, are in near relation with
the ass, their alter ego, who enjoys the blessing of eternal
youth. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u themselves, the two horsemen who have given youth to
the old Äyavanas, rode upon asses before they rode upon horses. The myth
of the gandharvÃ¢s and that of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the myth of the horse and
that of the ass, are intimately connected: from the gandharvÃ¢s the aÃ§vin
comes forth; from the mythical ass the horse comes out. This is
unnatural in zoology, but it is very natural in mythology: the sun
comes, now out of the grey shades of night, and now out of the grey
cloud. The Vedic hymns already present us with several interesting myths
concerning the ass. The ass of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u is swift; the devotees ask the AÃ§vinÃ¢u when
they are to yoke it, that they may be carried by it to the
sacrifice.[702] In another hymn, as the AÃ§vinÃ¢u
are two, so are their asses two (rÃ¢sabhÃ¢v aÃ§vinoá¸¥). Finally, the second
strophe of the 116th hymn offers us a twofold significant particularity,
viz., the ass, that vanquishes a thousand in the rich battlefield of
Yamas (or in the nocturnal battle, in the struggle in hell, in which the
ass appears as a real warrior, joined with riches, and fighting for
riches), and is helped by strong and rapid wings (in which it shows us
the ass that flies).[703]

[704] But in the same hymn we already
see the reverse of the medal, that is to say, the swift ones who deride
him who is not swift, the horses that are urged before the ass. [705] The solar hero, towards morning,
substitutes the horse for the ass, or appears with horses, leaving the
ass or asses behind. We have learned in the preceding chapter how, in
the heavenly race of the Vedic gods, the asses gained the palm of
victory; but it was an effort superior to their powers. The

informs
us that by this effort they lost their swiftness and became draught
animals, deprived of honey, but yet preserving great vigour in their
sperm, so that the male ass can generate offspring in two ways, that is,
mules by union with a mare, and asses by union with an ass. [706] Here, therefore, the ass is
already considered an animal of an essentially phallical nature, which
notion is confirmed by the precept of KÃ¢tyÃ¢yanas, recorded by Professor
Weber,

[707] which enjoins the sacrificing of
an ass to expiate violated chastity. To chastise the ass, to sacrifice
the ass, must mean the same as to chastise and to mortify the body,

[708] and especially the phallos; and
the Eastern and Western punishment of leading adulterers about upon an
ass has the same meaning; the real martyr, however, in this punishment
being the ass, who is exposed to every kind of derision and
ill-treatment. In the same way, the henpecked husband who allowed
himself to be beaten by his wife, used, in several villages of Piedmont,
only a few years ago, to be led about ignominiously upon an ass: a
husband who lets his wife impose upon him, and cannot subdue her,
deserves to be chastised by means of an ass; he is not a man, and his
ass, the emblem of his manly strength, must on this account suffer the
punishment,

because
he has not shown himself able to assert his marital rights. The
adulterer upon the ass, and the silly husband upon the ass, are
punishments for phallic offences in, and in connection with, the person
of that which represents the phallos: one is chastised for having
wished, in this regard, to do too much, and the other for not having
been able to do enough. On this account the condemned person was forced,
in similar cases, to ride upon an ass with his face turned towards the
animal's tail, another image which is yet more manifestly phallical;
whence the very name of the punishment, "asini caudam in manu
tenere."

[709] As to the other proverb which
says, "He to whom the ass belongs, holds him by the tail," it is
explained by the narrative of a peasant who drew his ass out of a swamp,
taking it by the tail; but this story too seems to have a phallic
signification. The
ass, therefore, is already deposed from his noble place as a
swift-footed courser in the

[710] Here the ass already appears as a
real monster, worthy even of the steel of the prince of the celestial
heroes himself, who prepares to combat him. The ass, therefore, is
already sacred to the monsters in the white YaÇµurvedas. [711]

[712] the slowness of the ass has
already become proverbial. The modest Bharatas excuses himself from not
being able to equal his brother RÃ¢mas in the science of government, just
as the ass, he says, cannot run like the horse, or other birds cannot
fly like the vulture. The mythical ass, moreover, appears in this epic
poem

[713] in a demoniacal and infernal
aspect:

Bharatas,
in fact, dreams of seeing his dead father DaÃ§arathas, in blood-coloured
clothes, borne to the southern funereal region on a car drawn by asses;
and we are told that when a man is seen upon a car drawn by asses, it is
a sign of his departure for the abode of Yamas. Kharas, a word which, as
we already know, means ass, is also the name of a younger brother of the
great monster RÃ¢vaá¹as. RÃ¢vaá¹as himself is drawn by asses upon a chariot
adorned with gold and gems. These asses have the faces of the monster
PiÃ§Ã¢ÄÃ¢s,

[714] that is, faces of parrots, as
Hanumant afterwards informs us when he speaks of the monsters which he
has seen in LaÃ±kÃ¢, which he also says are as swift as thought. [715] We know that the coursers of
RÃ¢vaá¹as were asses, and therefore the asses with the faces of the
PiÃ§Ã¢ÄÃ¢s, and the horses of the monsters with the faces of parrots, are
the same. The monster PiÃ§Ã¢ÄÃ¢s, therefore, has the face of a parrot. How
is it that the parrot is reared in India as a sacred bird? It appears to
me that equivocation in language had something to do with the formation
of this singular mythological image. The word

[716] We therefore

already
see here the golden ass and the infernal monster identified with the
sun; and hence we are very near the monster with the parrot's face. In
the preceding chapter we observed how the solar horse appears in the
morning luminous at first in its foremost parts,–now in its legs, now in
its face, now in its mane, which is called golden; it is only the head
of the horse which is found in the butter; of DadhyaÅÄ we perceive only
his head in connection with the ambrosia. Thus of the nocturnal ass, of
the demoniacal ass, of the demon himself, the piÃ§Ã¢Äas (the piÃ§Ã¢ÄÃ¢s are
called carnivorous

[717]), only the face is seen, in the
same way as of the piÃ§Ã¢ÄÃ¢s, and of the horses belonging to the monsters,
only the head is that of a parrot. But what connection can there be
between the gold colour of the ass piÃ§Ã¢Äas and the green colour of the
parrot? The equivoque lies probably in the words

shall see in the chapters concerning birds how the bird was often
substituted for the horse in the office of carrying the deity or the
hero. To conclude the subject of the Hindoo mythical ass, it is certain
that it existed in the heavens; it is certain that it flies in the sky,
that it fights in the sky like a valiant warrior, that it terrifies its
enemies in the sky with its terrible voice; that, in a word, it was a
real and legitimate heroic animal. It is certain, moreover, that,
considered under another aspect, it not only throws down the heroes, but
carries them to hell, serves the infernal monsters, and is found in
connection with the treasures of hell. Moreover, admitting, as I hope
the reader will, my identification of the mythical ass with the
gandharvas, we have the ass as dancer, the ass as musician, the ass who
loves women, and the ass in the odorous ointment and in the inebriating
drink, the somas which occupies the place of the wine of the Dionysian
mysteries, in which the Hellenic ass took a solemn part. In the fables of the PaÅÄatantram, the ass is partly
modelled on the Hellenic type and partly preserves its primitive
character. The fourth book shows us the ass twice attracted towards the
lion by the jackal, who induces him to believe that a beautiful female
ass is awaiting him. The ass is distrustful and shows his fear, but the
argument of the female ass, upon which the artful jackal insists,
overcomes his timidity. He is, however, cunning enough to send the
jackal before him; and at the sight of the lion he perceives the
jackal's treachery and turns, fleeing away with such rapidity that the
lion cannot overtake him. The jackal returns to the assault, and
convinces the ass that he did wrong to abandon the beautiful female ass
when he was on the point of receiving her favours; and thus touching
the
tender chord of his heart, he goes on to assure him that the female ass
will throw herself into the fire or the water if she does not see him
return. "Omnia vincit amor;" the ass returns, and this time the lion
surprises and tears him to pieces; upon which the lion, before partaking
of his meal, goes to perform his ablutions and devotions. Meanwhile the
jackal eats the ass's heart and ears, and makes the lion, on his return,
believe that the stupid animal had neither the one nor the other,
because if he had had them, he would not have returned to the dangerous
spot after having once escaped. The lion declares himself to be
perfectly satisfied with this explanation. Here we have a mixture in the
ass of swift-footedness, lust, and stupidity, his stupidity being caused
by his lustfulness. Now, it is possible that his acquaintance with the
Hellenic ass may have induced the author of the PaÅÄatantram to
embody in the ass a quality which is generally attributed in fables of
Hindoo origin to the monkey; but this is not absolutely necessary in
order to explain the narrative of which we have now given the
epitome. On the other hand, in the fourth book of the PaÅÄatantram,
the fable of the ass in the tiger's skin–an insignificant variety of the
ass in the lion's skin–was, as Professor Weber has already proved, taken
from the Ãsopian fable. Another fable, in the fifth book, which tells us
of the ass who, being passionately fond of music,[718] insisted upon singing, and was
thus discovered and made a slave of, also seems to be of Hellenic
origin. But, although the editing of these two Hindoo fables in a
literary form had its origin in the knowledge of Hellenic
literature, the original myth of the ass-lion (haris, which is the horse
of Indras, also means the lion), and that of the ass-musician (as
gandharvas and gardabhas), can be traced as far back as the Vedic
scriptures. [719] I find a new proof, which appears
to me a very satisfactory one, of the identification which I have
proposed of the ass with the gandharvas. I have already mentioned the
gandharvas who guards over the somas in the midst of the waters, and I
observed how the gandharvas ká¹iÃ§Ã¢nus of the VedÃ¢s, and the Zend kereÃ§Ã¢ni
who guards over the

In the first of the seven adventures of Rustem, in the
Shah-Name of Firdusi, the starving Rustem goes with his brave
heroic horse to chase wild asses. The asses flee, but the hero's horse
is swifter than they, and overtakes them; Rustem takes one by means of a
lasso, and has it cooked, throwing away the bones. He then goes to sleep
(then sometimes expresses in the myths the interval of a whole
day or of a whole year.–The hero does almost the same in his second
adventure and in the book of Sohrab). While Rustem sleeps, a
monstrous lion makes its appearance to surprise the hero; Rustem's
heroic horse throws the lion down and tears it to pieces with
its hoofs and teeth. This battle between the horse of the sleeping hero
and the monster lion is an epic form of the fable which represents the
animals as being terrified in the forest by the braying of the ass, and
of that of the lion itself killed by the ass's kick. Probably the bones
of the dead ass, when preserved, gave heroic strength to Rustem's
horse. [720] and now of a drum. We must not
forget that the word

In the twenty-second Mongol story we have a variety, though partly a
less complete and partly a richer one, of the fable of the Phrygian king
Midas. A king who has golden ass ears, has his head combed every night
with golden combs by young men, who are immediately after put to death
(to comb the ass's head is about the same as to wash it; but however
much it is combed, the ears can never be abolished). One day a young man
predestined to the highest honours, before going to comb the king's
head, receives from his mother a cake made of her own milk and flour. The young man offers the cake to the king, who likes it, and spares the
youth's life on condition that he tells no one, not even his mother, the
great secret, viz., that the king has golden ears. The youth
promises to preserve silence, and makes a very great effort indeed to
keep his promise, but this effort makes him seriously ill, so much so
that he feels he will burst if he does not tell the secret. His mother
then advises him to go and relieve his mind by whispering it into a
fissure of the earth or of a tree. The young man does so; he goes into
the open country, finds a squirrel's hole, and breathes gently down it,
"Our king has ass's ears;" but animals have understanding and can speak,
and there are men who understand their language. The secret is conveyed
from one to another, till the king hears that the young man has divulged
it. He threatens to take his life; but relents when he hears from him
how it happened, and not only pardons him, but makes him his prime
minister. The fortunate youth's first act is
to invent a cap of the shape of the ears of an ass, in order that the
king may be able to conceal the deformity; and when the people see the
king with a cap of this shape, it pleases them so much that they all
adopt it; and so the king, by means of his young minister, is no longer
obliged to live secluded, and in the constant tormenting dread of
discovery, but lives at his ease and happily ever afterwards. Having thus examined under its principal aspects the most popular
Asiatic tradition relative to the ass, let us now go on to epitomise the
European tradition, and, if possible, more briefly; all the more that
the reader, having, as I hope, now the key of the myth, will be of
himself able to refer to it many analogous particulars of GrÃ¦co-Latin
tradition. I say GrÃ¦co-Latin alone, because the myth of the ass among
Slavonic and Germanic nations, where the ass is little, if at all,
known, had no especial and independent development. In Slavonic
countries, the part of the ass is generally sustained by Ivan the fool
or Emilius the lazy one, as also by the bear or wolf, as in India it is
often sustained by the monkey;[721] ass, bear, wolf, and monkey, as
mythical animals, represent almost identical phenomena. Let us take the story of Midas again at its commencement. Midas appears in Herodotus, not only as a king of Phrygia,
but as a progenitor of the Phrygians. In the Tusculans of Cicero, the
drunken satyr Silenos (originally
another form of the same Midas, the satyrs having ass's ears), the
master of Dionysos, loses himself in the rose-garden belonging to Midas,
before whom he is conducted, and by whom he is benevolently received and
entertained, and then sent back with honour to the god, who, in
gratitude, concedes to Midas the gift of turning to gold everything that
he touches, to such an extent as to affect the food that he wishes to
eat and the water in which he bathes. This myth is probably of a complex
nature. Midas ought, like the ass, to turn to gold what he has eaten,
that is, to turn his food and drink into excrements of gold, to fructify
the golden ears of corn, i.e., in heaven, the solar rays. Cicero himself leads us to suppose that the myth of Midas is in relation
with the ears of corn, when, in his first book De Divinatione,
he says that the ants carried grains of wheat into the mouth of Midas
when a child; these being symbols of abundance and of fecundity which
are quite applicable to the mythical ass. For although the common ass is
not a privileged fÅ“cundator, the mythical ass, in its capacity of a
rain-giving cloud or Äiramehin, is the best fertiliser of the fields. The sun, or gold, or treasure, comes out of the ass-darkness or
ass-cloud. The ass Lucius, after having eaten the roses of morning or
the east, again becomes Lucius the luminous one (the sun). On this
account the ass Midas, too, who also delights in roses, turns to gold
whatever he eats, as well as the dew or ambrosial fountain in which he
bathes; the rosy becomes the golden; the sun comes out of the contact of
the ass of night with the aurora. Servius, in his commentary on the sixth book of the Ãneid,
also tells us the centauri "in floribus stabulant," as the Hindoo
gandharvas in the perfumes. These perfumes are rain and dew. The ass
crowned with loaves of
bread[722] and flowers, in the Latin worship
of Vesta, who remembered the service rendered to her one day by the
braying of the ass, which aroused her from her sleep when some one was
attempting to violate her, is another variety of the myth of the aurora
who awakes out of the night, golden, that is, rich in golden oats and in
golden wheat. The ass itself is sacrificed, because, perhaps, it was the
ass itself that had made an attempt to deprive Vesta of her chastity;
but having betrayed itself, as it often happens in fables, by its
braying, it arouses Vesta, who punishes it by offering it in sacrifice. In a variation of the same story in the first book of Ovid's
Fasti, where instead of Vesta we have the nymph Lothis asleep,
the red Priapos, who wishes to violate her, also loses his opportunity,
because the ass of Silenos–

"Intempestivos edidit ore sonos,"

on which account it is killed by Priapos:

"Morte dedit pÅ“nas auctor clamoris, et hÃ¦c est

Hellespontiaco victima sacra Deo."

The apologue is well known of the long-eared ass, who, when called
upon to judge between the nightingale and the cuckoo as to who has the
sweetest voice, decides in favour of the cuckoo. The nightingale then
appeals to man with the sweet song that we are all acquainted with.[723] In the myth of Midas, the Phrygian
hero is given
ass's ears as a chastisement by Apollo, because, having been called upon
to judge between the cithern or lyre of Apollo (whence the proverb
"Asinus ad lyram") and the pastoral pipe (calamus agrestis) of Pan (who
is represented as a horned and bearded satyr, with a tail and long
ears), he pronounced that the pan-pipes were the most harmonious
instrument. Midas hides his ears in a red cap, but his comber lets out
the secret, as in the Mongol story, and in a manner almost
identical–

"Ille quidem celat, turpique onerata pudore

Tempora purpureis tentat velare tiaris:

Sed, solitus longos ferro resecare
capillos,

Viderat hoc famulus: qui, cum nec prodere
visum

Dedecus auderet, cupiens efferre sub
auras,

Nec posset reticere tamen, secedit;
humumque

Effodit, et domini quales aspexerit
aures,

Voce refert parva: terrÃ¦que immurmurat
haustÃ¦. Indiciumque suÃ¦ vocis tellure regesta

Obruit, et scrobibus tacitus discedit
opertis. Creber arundinibus tremulis ibi surgere
lucus

CÅ“pit; et, ut primum pleno maturuit anno,

Prodidit agricolam: leni jam motus ab
Austro

Obruta verba refert; dominique coarguit
aures."[724]

The same Greeks who held the ass up to derision, made the Phrygian
king Midas, of the ass's ears, the object of their satire. This is a
particular form of the mythico-heroic struggle between Greeks and
Phrygians or Trojans. Apollo is the enemy of the Trojans, as he is the
enemy of the Phrygian king Midas. The Trojans and
Troy are represented by the ass, and the Greeks, who vanquish and take
by assault the Trojan fortress, by the horse; the sun disperses the
night; the hero kills the centaur; the horse defeats the ass, the Greek
the Trojan; and every one can see how the fact that the Greeks
personified in the ass their enemies in Asia Minor, must have damaged
the reputation of the poor long-eared animal. The most bitter and
cutting satire is always that which is directed towards one's own
enemies; and the ass, unfortunately, had at one time the honour of
representing the Phrygian, the traditional enemy of the Greek. The ass
bore the load of this heroic war, in the same way as in the Middle Ages
he was publicly impaled by the Paduans for having had the misfortune of
being the sacred animal on the arms of the city of Vicenza, with which
the Paduans lived in rivalry.[725]

In the same eleventh book of Ovid where the transformation of the
human ears of Midas into ass's ears is described, it is very remarkable
that the new ears are called whitish, as in the Mongol story they are
said to be golden. This confirms still more the interpretation of the
myth, to the effect that the ass is the solar steed during the night. The head and the tail of the night, conceived as an animal, are now the
two whitish or grey twilights, and now the two golden auroras of morning
and evening. "Nec Delius aures

Humanam stolidas patitur retinere
figuram,

Sed trahit in spatium villisque albentibus
implet

Instabilesque illas facit et dat posse
moveri."

In
the story of the ass, Midas, the musical critic, the predestined ass,
pronounces in favour of Pan; and he does so not only on account of the
consanguinity between himself and the god, but also from a patriotic
feeling. Pan was born in a forest of Arcadia, of Zeus and the nymph
Kallisto; and it is well known that antiquity celebrated the asses of
Arcadia above those of every other country. The ass as a musician, the
ass as a musical critic, Pan the musician, and Pan preferred by the ass,
are the same person. Arcadia, the country of pastoral music, of
whistling shepherds, which made the Italy of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries bleat out so many useless verses, the country of
Pan the satyr,

[726] and therefore, when the Olympians
came down from heaven, celestial nymphs and satyrs came to people the
forests and fountains of Arcadia. The divine guardian of the ambrosia in
the heavenly cloud takes, in the Arcadian forest, the form of Pan, god
of shepherds, who keeps guard over the honey. The gandharvÃ¢s, who danced
and sung in the Hindoo Olympus with the apsarasas, has descended into
Arcadia in the shape of Pan, to dance and sing with the nymphs. [727] Pan who goes alone into the gloomy
forest, Pan who chases fear away, connected as he is

with
the story of the ass, reminds us on the one hand of the superstition
recorded by Pliny, to the effect that an ass's skin put upon children
chases fear from them

[728] (in the same way as in the
province of Girgenti, in Sicily, it is believed that shoes made of a
wolf's skin, put on children's feet, make them daring and lucky in
battle), and, on the other hand, of the unpublished Piedmontese story of
the fearless Giovannino, who, in reward for his courage in going alone
to hell, brings away with him an ass which throws gold from its
tail. [729] In

Tzetzas

[730] I find again the curious notion
that Midas sold his own

[731] in the heroic battle of Marathon,
the Athenians were helped by the powerful voice of the god Pan. Finally,
as we have seen Apollo to be the rival of Pan and the enemy of the
Phrygian Midas, the predestined ass, as well as of the Trojans, so, in
the eleventh of the Pythic odes of Pindar, we find the hero Perseus,
among the Hyperboreans,

[732] eating asses. [733] The morning sun devours the ass of
night, as we have seen the solar hero Rustem do in the

But we must look for more mythical personages in connection with the
ass Midas in Arcadia, as the region of Pan and of asses. The ass Midas
is considered as a rich progenitor of races, and is supposed to have
been the first Phrygian. Windischmann has already observed (with
the examples of Yamas, Yima, Manus, Minos, and RadamanthÃ¼s) the
connection between the rich progenitor of races and the rich king or
judge of hell. To Midas the progenitor and to Midas the judge,
corresponds the ass whose excrements are of gold, the ass judge and
prophet, the Arcadian and prophetic Pan. The Arcadians considered
themselves not only autocthonoi, but proselÃªnoi, or anterior to the
moon. But they are also considered in the light of inhabitants of an
infernal region. In Arcadia was situated the lake StÃ¼mphalos, the
demoniacal birds of which were slain by HÃªraklÃªs in Arcadia; in a chasm
formed of wild rocks was the source of the Styx, the principal infernal
river, that by which the Hellenic infernal beings were accustomed to
swear. Greek and Latin writers used to narrate of the ass (and the mule)
that it had an especial aversion to the water of the Styx, as being
poisonous. This superstition, when referred to the myth, appears to mean
that, when the solar hero drinks this water–the water of the dark or
cloudy ocean–he becomes a dark ass. (We find in Russian stories the hero
who is transformed into a bull, a horse, or a he-goat, when he drinks
water of which a demoniacal bull, horse, or he-goat has previously
drunk.) Ãlianos, in his tenth book relative to animals, speaking of the
horned asses of Scythia, writes that they held in their horns the water
of the Styx. A similar narrative is given by Philostratos in the third
book of his romantic Life of Apollonios, concerning the fabulous horned
ass of India. "It is said," he writes, "that in the marshy ground near
the Indian river Hyphasis many wild asses are to be found; and that
these wild beasts have on their heads a horn with which they fight
bravely like bulls" (this seems to be a reminiscence of the Indian
rhinoceros); "and that the Indians form out of these
horns drinking-cups, affirming that those who drink out of these cups
are delivered from every illness for all that day; when wounded they
feel no pain, they pass safely through flames, nor, when they have drunk
out of it, can they be hurt by any poison. They say that these cups
belong to kings alone, nor is it permitted to any other than a king to
hunt the animal. It is narrated that Apollonios (the hero of the
romance) had seen this animal and observed its nature with wonder. Moreover, to Damis, who asked him whether he had faith in what was
commonly said concerning the virtue of this cup, he answered 'I will
believe it when I shall have learned that in this country the king is
immortal.'" And no doubt Apollonios would have believed had it been
impossible for him to divine that the king who makes use of this
marvellous cup is the immortal sun, to whom alone it is reserved to kill
the ass of the nocturnal forest, the ass whose hairy ears are like
horns,[734] whose ears are of gold. The horn of the Scythian ass full of Stygian water, the horn of the
ass which, when used as a cup, gives health and happiness to him who
drinks out of it, remind us (not to speak of Samson's jaw-bone of an
ass, which makes water flow) especially of the myth of the cornucopia
and that of the goat, with which the satyrs and fauns, having goat's
feet, stand in particular connection. It is also for this reason that
the ass is found in relation with Pan; wherefore it is too that Silenos
rides upon an ass, and appears, as we have already seen, in the story of
Midas, in his garden of roses; indeed the
mythical centaurs or onocentaurs, satyr, faun, ass, and goat are
equivalent expressions. We have seen, a few pages back, the Zendic
three-legged ass; in the following chapter we shall find the lame
goat. [735] so was he the animal dedicated to
Bacchus and to Priapos, whose mysteries were celebrated in the Dionysian
feasts. It is said that when Bacchus had to traverse a marsh, he met
with two young asses, and was conveyed by one of them, who was endowed
with human speech, to the other side without touching the water. (The
116th hymn of the first book of the

[736] On this account it is said that
Bacchus, in gratitude, placed the two young asses among the stars. [737] This is another confirmation of
the fact that the mythical ass really had the virtue of flying; and the
proverb "Asinus si volat habet alas"

[738] alludes to this myth. The fable of
the ass who wishes to fly, and the flight of the ass, are derisive
allusions, applied to the earthly ass. The
celestial myth lingers in the memory, but is no longer understood. In the myth of Prometheus, in Ãlianos (vi. 5), we have the
ass who carries the talisman which makes young again, which Zeus
intended for him who should discover the robber of the divine fire
(Prometheus). The ass, being thirsty, approaches a fountain, and is
about to drink, when a snake who guards the fountain prevents him from
doing so. The ass offers the snake the charm which he is carrying, upon
which the serpent strips off its old age, and the ass, drinking at the
fountain, acquires the power of becoming young again. The ass of night,
when he drinks the dew of the dawn, grows young and handsome again every
day. It is on this account, I repeat, that youth is celebrated as a
peculiar virtue of the ass; it is on this account that the Romans
attributed a great cosmetic virtue to ass's milk[739] (the white dawn, or moon). The mythical ass seems to die every day, whereas, on the contrary it
is born anew every day, and becomes young again; whence the Greek
proverb does not celebrate the death in the singular, but the deaths of
the ass ("Onou thanatous"). The Italian proverb of the ass that carries wine and drinks water,
probably alludes to the ass that carries the water of youth, and then,
being thirsty, drinks at the fountain in the legend of Prometheus. The
wine of the
Hellenic and Latin myth corresponds to the inebriating drink or somas in
which Indras delights so much in the á¹igvedas. The ass bears
the drunken Silenos on its back. The sun, who in the cloud is covered with the skin of an ass, carries
the rain; whence the Greek proverb the ass is wetted by the rain ("Onos
hÃ¼etai"), and the popular belief that when the ears of the ass or of a
satyr (that is to say, of the ass itself) move, it is an indication of
rainy weather (or dew). When the sun comes out of the shadows of night,
he drinks the milk or white humour of the early morning sky, the same
white foaming humour which caused the birth of AphroditÃª, the same
humour out of which, by the loves of Dionysos (or of Pan, of a satyr, or
of the ass itself) and AphroditÃª, the satyr was procreated–Priapos,
whose phallic loves are discovered by the ass. The satyr serves as a
link between the myth of the ass and that of the goat. On this account
(that is, on account of the close relation between the mythical ass and
the mythical goat) two ancient Greek and Latin proverbs–i.e.,
to dispute about the shadow of the ass ("Peri onou skias") and to
dispute, "De lana caprina"–have the same meaning, a dispute concerning a
bagatelle (but which is no trifle in the myth, where the skin of the
goat or of the ass is sometimes changed into a golden fleece), which
seems so much the more probable, as the Greeks have also handed down to
us another proverb in which the man who expects to reap where he has not
sown is laughed at as one who looks for the wool of the ass ("Onou pokas
zÃªteis"), or who shears the ass ("Ton onon keireis"). We have seen, in
the myth of Midas, the king, whose ears, when combed, betray his asinine
nature. The Piedmontese story of the maiden on whose forehead a horn or
an ass's tail grows, because she has badly combed the good
fairy's head, is connected with this story of the combing of the
long-eared Midas. The combed ass and the sheared ass correspond with one
another; the combed ass has golden ears, in the same way as gold and
gems fall from the head of the good fairy combed by the good girl in the
fairy tale. To this mythical belief, I think, may be traced the origin
of the mediÃ¦val custom in the Roman Church, which lasted till the time
of Gregory VII., in which public ovations were offered to the Pope, and
an ass bearing money upon its head was brought before him.[740]

[741] betrays him, no less than his
ears, his nose, and his braying. The shadow of the ass and his nose are
found in connection with each other in the legend of the Golden Ass of
Apuleius, which, after narrating how the ass, by putting his head out of
the window, had betrayed his master the greengrocer or gardener (the
friend of perfumes, "Gandharvas, asinus, in unguento, onos en mÃ¼ro"),
concludes thus: "The miserable gardener having been found again, and
taken before the magistrates to pay the fine, they lead him to a public
prison, and with great laughter cease not, says the ass Lucius, to "make
merry with my face;" whence also was derived the popular proverb
concerning the face and shadow of the ass ('De prospectu et umbra
asini')." The ass who betrays his master the greengrocer or gardener by
his face is a variety of the ass who, dressed in the forest

in
the lion's skin

[742] (like HÃªraklÃªs who goes into hell
dressed in a lion's skin), betrays himself by his braying, and of the
ass who discovers by his braying Priapos, who delights in gardens (the
vulva), Priapos the gardener, like the ogre

[743] of the

The ass can restrain neither his voice nor his flatus; we have
already seen something similar in the story of Midas, where the comber
of the ass feels he will burst if he is not permitted to relieve himself
of the secret of the ass. DiogenÃªs of Laertes narrates that the fields
of Agrigentum being devastated by malignant winds which destroyed the
crops, the philosopher Empedocles instructed them to take asses' skins,
and having made sacks of them, carry them to the summits of the hills
and mountains, to chase the winds away. Ãlianos, confounding one noise
with another, suggests, to prevent the ass from braying, the advantage
of appending a stone
to its tail. This ancient Greek fable is to this day very popular in
Italy, and the narrator is accustomed to furbish it up with a character
of actuality, as if it had happened yesterday, and among his
acquaintances. In the Italian stories,[744] when the ass brays upon the
mountain, a tail grows on the forehead of the step-mother's ugly
daughter; the third crowing of the cock is the signal for the monster's
death; the third braying or flatus of the ass announces the death of the
fool. With the end of the night the ass disappears, and the fool also
disappears or dies. The braying of the ass cannot mount up into heaven;
after the ass has brayed, after the cloud has thundered, the ass comes
down upon the earth, is dissolved into rain, is dispersed and dies; the
dark ass cannot remain in the luminous sky, it can only inhabit the
cloudy, watery, or gloomy sky of hell. The way in which the fool of the
story tries to elude death resembles that which was used, according to
Ãlianos, to prevent the ass from braying. In a story of Armagnac,[745] Joan lou PÃ©c runs after a man whom
he believes to be a sage, and asks him when he will die; the man
answers, "Joan lou PÃ©c, mouriras au troisiÃ¨mo pet de toun ase." The ass
does so twice; the fool endeavours to prevent the third: "Cop sec
s'en-angonc cerca
un pau (a stake) bien pounchut et l'enfouncÃ©c das un martet dens lou cu
de l'ase. Mes l'ase s'enflec tant, e hasconc tant gran effort, que lou
pau sourtisconc coumo no balo e tuÃ¨c lou praube Joan lou PÃ©c."

In Herodotus, the Scythians are defeated when the asses
bray, and the dogs bark among Darius's tents. The braying of the ass,
the thunder of the cloud, is an oracle; the ass that brays is a judge
and a prophet. In hell everything is known; the devil knows every art,
every species of malice, every secret; the ass in hell participates in
this knowledge. The ass Nicon, in Plutarch, in the Life of
Antony, predicts to Augustus his victory at the battle of Actium; on the
contrary, in the Life of Alexander, by the same author, an ass who kills
with a kick a great lion belonging to the Macedonian, appears to the
great conqueror in the light of an evil omen. The dying sun of evening,
the old lion, is killed in the evening by the ass of night; in the
morning, on the contrary, the ass of night announces his fortune to the
solar hero, who again becomes luminous and wise. The ass can predict all
things, because it knows all things; it knows everything, because it
hears everything, and it hears everything by means of its exceedingly
long ears; the ass of Apuleius says of itself: "Recreabar quod auribus
prÃ¦ditus cuncta longule etiam dissita sentiebam." And this ass which
listens from a distance reminds us again of the third brother, now a
fool, and now only supposed to be a fool; to the Andalusian Oidin-Oidon,
hijo del buen oidor (a relation of the already cited Vedic Indras
Ã¢Ã§rutkará¹as), of the second cuento of Caballero,[746] who hears everything that is done
in the deepest parts of
hell, where Lucifer sits, horned and large-eared. The hero who combats
with Lucifer only thinks of cutting off his ear; the ass without ears is
no longer an ass; the ears of the mythical ass are its vital and
characteristic organs. Instead of ears, give horns to the mythical ass,
and we have the mythical goat; take the horns away and we have now the
mythical abject sheep, now the hog; this is what we shall see in the two
next chapters. CHAPTER

mythical goat; its threefold form; black, white, and light-coloured
lambs.–Pecus and pecunia. When the girl aurora leads out of the stable in the morning her
radiant flock, among them there are found to be white lambs, white kids,
and luminous sheep; in the evening the same aurora leads the lambs, the
kids, and the sheep back to the fold. In the early dawn all this flock
is white, by and by their fleeces are golden fleeces; the white, and
afterwards the golden heavens of the east (or the west) constituting
this white and golden flock, and the sun's rays their fleeces. Then the
sun himself, who steps forth from this flock, is now its young
shepherd-king, and now the lamb, the ram, or he-goat. When the sun
enters into the region of night, the he-goat or lamb goes back to the
fold and becomes dark-coloured; the sun veiled by the night or the cloud
is a dark-coloured ram, he-goat, or she-goat. In the night, says the
proverb, all cows are black; and the same might be said of goats, except
in the case of the goat, luminous and all-seeing, coming out of the
nocturnal darkness in the form of the moon. We must, therefore, consider
the sheep or goat under a triple aspect; the principal and most
interesting aspect being that of the sun veiled by the gloom, or by the
cloud, which wears often a demoniacal form, such as that of the ass or
of the hero in hell; the second being that of the grey-white, and
afterwards golden sky of morning, or of the golden and thereafter
grey-white sky of evening
which, as a luminous, is therefore generally a divine form of the goat;
and the third aspect being that of the moon. [747] The ram is called

[748] a goat, we have

Sanská¹it
from

Let us now first of all see how these simple images developed
themselves in the Hindoo myth. [749] in the second strophe, as the one
who pours out ambrosial honey (madaÄyutam); in the third strophe, as
opening the stable or precinct of the cows to the AÃ±girasas;

[750] in the fourth strophe, as killing
the serpent that covers or keeps back; in the fifth strophe, as
expelling the enchanters with enchantments, and breaking the strong
cities of the monster Piprus;

[751] and in the sixth strophe, as
crushing under his foot the giant-like monster Arbudas

[752] or monster serpent. Thus far we
have two aspects of the myth, the ram which pours out ambrosial honey,
and the ram which opens the gate and crushes with its foot. In another
hymn the AÃ§vinÃ¢u are compared to two he-goats (aÇµeva), to two horns
(Ã§á¹iÃ±geva), and to two swift dogs. [753] A third hymn informs us

that
Indras by means of a ram killed a leonine monster. [754]

Here we evidently have a heroic he-goat or ram. Let us compare it with other traditions. In the Khorda
Avesta[755] we find Veretraghna (the Zend form
of Indras, as Vá¹itrahan) "with the body of a warrior he-goat, handsome,
and with sharpened horns."

[756] the lamb, companion of the bull in
the wood, kills the wolf by butting against its sides, while the bull
also wounds the ferocious beast with its horns. In another variation of
the same story,

[757] the cat is confederate with the
lamb against the wolf; the lamb butts hard at the wolf, while the cat
scratches it till blood flows. In yet another version, besides the lamb,
the he-goat also appears; the cat twists some of the bark of the
birch-tree round the horns of the he-goat, and bids the lamb rub against
it to produce fire; sparks come from it, the cat fetches hay, and the
three companions warm themselves. The wolves come up, and the cat makes
them run, presenting them the goat as a scarecrow, and frightening them
further by ominous hints as to the strength contained in its beard. Finally, we have in the Russian stories two singular variations of the
fable of the goat, the kids, and the wolf. [758]

The
goat is about to give birth to her young ones under an apple-tree. (We
have seen in Chapter I. the apple-tree, the fruit of which, when eaten,
causes horns to sprout. It is well-known that in Greek,

[759] upon which the goat goes to a
deserted tent in the forest, another form of the cloud of night. When
the kids are brought forth, the goat issues

forth out of the tent to procure food, and cautions her children not to
open to any one (the fable is well known in the West, but the Slavonic
variations are particularly interesting). The wolf comes and pronounces
the same password as the goat to induce the kids to open, but they
perceive by the rough voice of the wolf that it is not their mother, and
refuse to admit him. The wolf then goes to the blacksmith, and has a
voice made for him resembling that of the goat; the deceived kids open,
and the wolf devours them all except the smallest, who hides under the
stove (the favourite place where the little Slavonic hero, the third
brother, the ill-favoured fool, who afterwards becomes handsome and
wise, is accustomed to squat). The goat returns, and learns from the kid
which has escaped the massacre of its brothers. She thinks how to avenge
herself, and invites her friend and gossip the fox with the wolf to
dinner; the unsuspecting wolf arrives along with the fox. After dinner,
the goat, to divert her guests, invites them to amuse themselves by
leaping over an opening made in the floor; the goat leaps first, then
the fox leaps, and then the wolf, but falls down on the burning ashes
and is burnt to death, like the witch in some other stories, as the
night is burned by the morning aurora; and the goat chaunts a marvellous

the
kids alone; they shut the door after her. She returns and says, "Open,
my sons, my little fathers; your mother is come; she has brought some
milk, half a side full of milk, half a horn full of fresh cheese, half a
little horn full of clear water (the cornucopia)."

[760] The kids open immediately. The
second day the goat goes out again; the wolf, who had heard the song,
tries to sing it to the kids; but the latter perceive that it is not
their mother's voice, and do not open. Next day the wolf again imitates
the mother's voice; the kids open the door, and are all devoured except
one which hides itself in the stove, and afterwards narrates to the
mother-goat all that has happened. The goat avenges herself as follows:
She goes into the forest with the wolf, and comes to a ditch where some
workmen had cooked some gruel, and left the fire still burning. The goat
challenges the wolf to leap the ditch; the wolf tries and falls into it,
where the fire makes his belly split open, from which the kids, still
alive, skip out and run to their mother. Another story, however,[761] affords us still more aid in the
interpretation of the myth; that is, in leading us to see in the goat
and her kids the sun horned or furnished with rays, as it issues radiant
out of the cloud, or darkness, or ocean of night, and in the wolf, or in
the wolf's skin, split open or burned, out of which the kids come, the
dark, cloudy, watery nocturnal sky. Instead of the wolf we have a witch,
instead of the goat a woman, and instead of the kids the young Vaniushka
(Little John); the witch has a voice made by the blacksmith like that of
Vaniushka's or TereshiÄko's mother, and thus attracts him to her. TereshiÄha says that he was originally the stump of a tree, which his
father and mother, being childless, had picked up in the forest, and
wrapped up and rocked in a cradle till he was born. The monster wolf, or the witch, having the faculty of simulating the
voice of the goat,[762] and an especial predilection for
both sheep and goats,–so much so that the witch Liho (properly Evil)
keeps some in her house, and those which come out (of the dark sky) in
the morning, and which re-enter (the dark sky) in the evening, are
considered her peculiar property,[763]–often transforms the hero (the
evening sun) into a kid (into the darkness or cloud of night). Of
course, as the dark and cloudy monster is often represented as a wolf,
it is easy to understand his wish that everything should be transformed
into
a lamb in order to eat it. But the mythical lamb or kid, the young solar
hero, generally escapes out of the jaws of the wolf, out of the hands of
the witch, or out of the darkness, the waters, or the cloud of
night. A Vedic hymn celebrates the strong PÃ»shan, who has a he-goat for his
horse (or who is a goat-horse), and is called the lover of his sister. Perhaps these words contain the germ of the Russian story of Little
John, brother of Little Helen, who is changed by witchcraft into a kid. I have already observed in Chapter I. how Helen, who at the commencement
of the story shows affection for her brother John, ends by betraying
him. The Vedic hymn would appear to contain the notion of the brother
PÃ»shan transformed into a he-goat (the sun which enters into the cloud
or darkness of night), because he has loved his sister. In another Vedic
hymn we have the sister YamÃ®, who seduces her brother Yamas. In European
fairy tales, the sister loves her brother, who is metamorphosed by the
art of a witch, now into a young hog, and now into a kid. In the
forty-fifth story of the fourth book of Afanassieff, Ivanushka
(Little John) becomes a kid after drinking out of a goat's hoof. In the
twenty-ninth story of the second book of Afanassieff, Ivanushka
and Little Helen, the children of a Tzar, wander alone about the world. Ivanushka wishes to drink where cows, horses, sheep, and hogs feed and
drink; his sister Little Helen advises him not to do so, lest he should
turn into a calf, a colt, a lamb, or a young pig; but at last John is
overcome by thirst, and, against the advice of his sister, he drinks
where goats drink, and becomes a kid. A young Tzar marries the sister,
and gives every honour to the kid, but a witch throws the young queen
into the sea (Phrixos and Helle; in other European stories, into a
cistern), and usurps her place,
inducing the people to believe that she is Helen, and commanding the kid
to be put to death. The kid runs to the shore and invokes his sister,
who answers from the bottom of the sea that she can do nothing. The
young Tzar, to whom the affair is referred, hastens to deliver Helen out
of the sea; the kid can again skip about in safety, and everything is
green again, and flourishes as much as it withered before; the witch is
burnt alive.[764]

According to the fiftieth story of the sixth book of
Afanassieff, a merchant has three daughters. He builds a new
house, and sends his three daughters by turns to pass the night there,
in order to see what they dream about. (The belief that the man dreamed
of by a maiden during the night of St John's Day, Christmas Day, or the
Epiphany, is her predestined husband, still exists in the popular
superstitions of Europe.) The eldest daughter dreams that she marries a
merchant's son, the second a noble, and the third a he-goat. The father
commands his youngest daughter never to go out of the house; she
disobeys; a he-goat appears and carries her off upon his horns towards a
rocky place. Saliva and mucous matter fall from the goat's mouth and
nostrils; the good maiden is not disgusted, but patiently wipes the
goat's mouth. This pleases the animal, who tells her that if she had
shown horror towards him, she would have had the same fate as his former
wives, whose heads were impaled on a stake. The geese bring to the girl
news of her father and sisters; they announce that the eldest sister is
about to be married; she wishes to be present at the wedding, and is
permitted by the goat to go, who orders for her use
three horses as black as a crow, who arrive at their destination in
three leaps (the three steps of Vishá¹us), whilst he himself sits upon a
flying carpet, and is transported to the wedding in the form of a
handsome and young stranger. The same happens on the occasion of the
second sister's marriage, when the third sister guesses that this
handsome youth is her own husband. She departs before the rest, comes
home, finds the skin of the goat and burns it; then her husband always
preserves the form of a handsome youth, inasmuch as the enchantment of
the witch has come to an end.[765]

The lamb, the he-goat, and the sheep are favourite
forms of the witch. In the European story, when the beautiful princess,
in the absence of the prince, her husband, gives birth to two beautiful
sons, the witch induces the absent prince to believe that, instead of
real sons, his young wife has given birth to pups. In the seventh story
of the third book of Afanassieff, the young queen gives birth,
during the king's absence, to two sons, of whom one has the moon on his
forehead, and the other a star on the nape of his neck (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u). The wicked sister of the young queen buries the children. Where they
were buried a golden sprout and a silver one spring up. A sheep feeds
upon these plants, and gives birth to two lambs, having, the one the
moon on its head, the other a star on its neck. The wicked sister, who
has meanwhile been married to the king, orders them to be torn in
pieces, and their intestines to be thrown out into the road. The good
lawful queen has them cooked, eats them, and again gives birth to her
two sons, who grow up hardy and strong, and who, when interrogated by
the king, narrate to him the story of their origin; their mother is
recognised, and becomes once more the king's wife; the wicked sister is
put to death.[766]

The witch is sometimes herself (as a wolf-cloud or
wolf-darkness) a devourer of young luminous kids or lambs, such as the
Schmierbock in the Norwegian story. The witch carries Schmierbock three
times away in a sack; the first and second time Schmierbock escapes by
making a hole in the sack; but the third time the witch succeeds in
carrying him to her house, where she prepares to eat him. The cunning
Schmierbock, however, smuggles the witch's own daughter into his place,
and, climbing up, conceals himself in the chimney (a variation of the
stove, the place where the young Russian hero usually hides himself, in
the same way as in the Tuscan story the foolish Pimpi conceals himself
in the oven). From this post of security he laughs at the witch, who
endeavours to recapture him; he throws a stone down the chimney and
kills her, upon which he descends, rifles her treasure-stores, and
carries off all her gold. Here the young hero is called a he-goat; in
the chapter on the wolf, we shall find the witch of the Norwegian story
actually bears the name of wolf. These two data complete the myth; the
wolf which wishes to devour the little hero, and the witch who
endeavours to eat the little lamb, are completed by the fable which
represents the wolf as, at the rivulet, eating the lamb, which, in the
mythical heavens, means the cloudy and gloomy monster which devours the
sun. We have seen above the witch who imitates the voice of the mother of
the little hero, in order to be able to eat him, and the wolf who mimics
the voice of the goat and eats the kids; but the wolf does more than
assume the goat's voice; he sometimes even takes her form. [767] AÇµamukhÃ®, or goat's face, is
called a witch, who wishes SÃ®tÃ¢ to be torn to pieces. In

the
legend of Ilvalas and VÃ¢tÃ¢pis,

[768] the two wizard brothers who
conspire to harm the BrÃ¢hmaá¹Ã¢s, VÃ¢tÃ¢pis transforms himself into a
wether, and lets himself be sacrificed in the funeral rites by the
BrÃ¢hmaá¹Ã¢s. The unsuspecting BrÃ¢hmaá¹Ã¢s eat its flesh; then Ilvalas cries
out to his brother, "Come forth, O VÃ¢tÃ¢pis!" and his brother, VÃ¢tÃ¢pis,
comes out of the bodies of the BrÃ¢hmaá¹Ã¢s, lacerating them, until the
á¹ishis Agastyas eats of himself the whole of VÃ¢tÃ¢pis, and burns Ilvalas
to ashes. The

[769] when it narrates the legend of
AhalyÃ¢. It is said in this passage that the god Indras was one day
condemned to lose his testicles by the malediction of the á¹ishis
GÃ¢utamas, with whose wife, AhalyÃ¢, he had committed adultery. The gods,
moved to pity, took the testicles of a ram and gave them to Indras, who
was therefore called MeshÃ¢á¹á¸as; on this account, says the

and

[770] Evidently the father of the solar
hero is here the gloomy monster of night himself; the sun, at evening,
becomes the devourer of the rams who come out of the she-wolf, or who
belong to the she-wolf; it is for this reason that the monster wolf
blinds him when evening comes. The red horse á¹iÇµrÃ¢Ã§vas, or the hero of
the red horse, who eats the rams of the she-wolf, affords a further key
to enable us to understand the expiatory goat, which in the

[771] and the

[772] This sacrificed he-goat appears to
be the same as the ass which undergoes punishment for all the animals in
the

celebrated
fable of Lafontaine (which becomes a bull in the hands of the Russian
fabulist Kriloff, who could not introduce the ass, an animal almost
unknown in Russia); and we already know that the ass represents the sun
in the cloud or the sun in the darkness; and we have also said that the
ass and the fool die together in the legend. The she-goat dies in the
Russian story to deliver the fool, who, after her death, is a fool no
longer, his folly having died with her. [773] The popular story offers us
another proof of the identity of the mythical ass and the mythical goat. We have also seen above, in the Norwegian story, how the witch possesses
a treasure which is carried off by the Schmierbock, who kills her; the
magician, or the devil, is always rich. The ass which the devil gives to
Little Johnny throws gold from its tail; the ass personifies the devil. But the devil, as we have observed, also has a predilection to embody
himself in a ram, a lamb, or a he-goat. I remember the puppets who every
day improvised popular representations in the little wooden theatre on
the Piazza Castello, at Turin, when I was a boy; the final doom of the
personage who represented the tyrant was generally to die under the
bastinadoes of Arlecchino, or to be carried to hell by the devil in the
form of a bleating lamb, which came

upon the scene expressly to carry him away with him, this disappearance
being accompanied by much throbbing of the spectators' hearts, to whom
the manager preached a salutary sermon. [774] In the twenty-first of the Tuscan
stories published by me, it is not the devil, but the little old man,
GesÃ¹, who gives to the third brother, instead of the usual ass, a putrid
sheep, which, however, has the virtue of throwing louis-d'or behind it. This putrid, or wet, or damp sheep represents still better the damp
night. [775] as durdá¹iÃ§ikas, or making to see
badly, damaging the eyesight, and the name of aÇµakÃ¢, given to an illness
in

the
eyes by the Hindoo physician SuÃ§rutas. However, we must not forget the
connection between the idea of skin and that of goat, by which the aÇµakÃ¢
might mean simply the thin membrane that sometimes harms the pupil of
the eye, and produces blindness. This thin membrane, stretched over the
eye of the solar hero, blinds him. We shall see in the chapter on the
frog and the toad, which very often represent, in the myths, the cloud
and the damp night, that the toad

[776] causes blindness only by means of
the venom which it is fabled to exude, like the reptile aÇµakÃ¢vas. But, as the hero in hell learns and sees everything, the goat, which
deprives others of sight, has itself the property of seeing everything;
this is the case, because the goat, being the sun enclosed in the cloud
or gloomy night, sees the secrets of hell, and also because, being the
horned moon or starry sky, it is the spy of the heavens. We have already
observed in the first chapter how the marvellous girl of seven years of
age, to answer the acted riddle proposed by the Tzar, arrives upon a
hare, which, in mythology, represents the moon. In a variation of the
same story given by Afanassieff,[777] instead of riding upon a hare, the
royal boy comes upon a goat, and is recognised by his father; the goat,
in its capacity of steed of the lost hero, seems here to represent the
moon, as the hare does. of
Zeus, is the Hellenic equivalent of this form of Indras. In Chapter I. we also saw the witch's daughter of the Russian fairy tale who has three
eyes, and with her third eye plays the spy over the cow, which protects
the good maiden. In the second story of the sixth book of

[778] the old man finds in heaven a
little house guarded in turns by twelve goats, of which one has one eye,
another two, a third three, and so on up to twelve. The old man says to
one after the other, "One eye, two eyes, three eyes, &c., sleep." On
the twelfth day, instead of saying "twelve eyes," he makes a mistake and
says "eleven;" the goat with twelve eyes then sees and secures him. The
eye of God which sees everything, in the popular faith, is a variation
of Argos PanoptÃªs, the Vedic ViÃ§vavedas, and the Slavonic Vsievedas, the
eye of the goat which sees what is being done in heaven. When the moon
shines in the sky, the stars grow pale, the eyes of the witch of heaven
fall asleep, but some few eyes still stay open, some few stars continue
to shine to observe the movements of the cow-moon, the fairy-moon, the
Madonna-moon, who protects the young hero and the beautiful solar maiden
lost in the darkness of night. constellation of the goat and two kids. Columella writes that the kids
appear in the sky towards the end of September, when the west, and
sometimes the south, wind blows and brings rain. According to Servius,
the goat united with the two kids in the constellation of Aquarius is
the same goat which was the nurse of Zeus; he says that it appears in
October, with the sign of Scorpio. Ovid, in

[779] also celebrate the goat and the
kids of heaven as bringers of rain. Horace, in the seventh ode,
elegantly calls the goat's stars insane:–

"Ille nothis actus ad Oricum

Post insana caprÃ¦ sidera, frigidas

Noctes non sine multis

Insomnis lachrymis agit."

[780] is a form of the same pluvial
Indras who supports the heavens in the rainy season. We have seen the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u compared to two goats, two horns, two hoofs; each, therefore,
would seem to have

but
one horn, but one goat's foot (which might perhaps explain the ekapÃ¢d
aÇµaá¸¥); hence on one side the cornucopia, and on the other the lame
goat. [781] The nymph Galathea (the milky
one), who loves a faun (or one who has goat's feet), seems to be a
Hellenic form of the loves of Esmeralda and the goat with Quasimodo. The
goat loves him who has goat's feet; the solar hero (or heroine) in the
night has goat's feet; he is a satyr, a faun, a he-goat, an ass; he is
deformed and foolish, but he interests the good fairy, who, in the form
of a she-goat (as the moon and as the milky way), guides him in the
night, and, as the dawn (white aurora) in the morning, saves him and
makes him happy. In the German legend, the poor princess who, with her
son, is persecuted in the forest, is assisted now by a she-goat, now by
a doe, which gives milk to the child; by means of this animal, which
serves as his guide, the prince finds his lost bride. This guiding
she-goat, or doe, the nurse of the child-hero, which Servius recognised
in the constellation of the goat (with respect to Zeus, who is
essentially pluvial, as the Vedic Indras has the clouds himself for his
nurses), must have generally represented the moon. But even the milky
way of the sky (the bridge of souls) is the milk spilt by the she-goat
of heaven; the white morning sky is also the milk of this same she-goat. The horned moon,

[782] the milky way, and the white dawn
are represented in the form of a beneficent she-goat which assists the
hero and

the
heroine in the forest, in the darkness; whilst, on the contrary, the sun
enclosed in the cloud, the darkness, or the starry sky of night (with
the insana caprÃ¦ sidera), is now a good and wise he-goat or ram, full of
good advice, like the ram who advises the king of India in the

[783] and now a malignant monster, a
demoniacal being. Inasmuch as the goat gives light and milk, it is
divine; inasmuch as it conceals the beauty of the young hero or heroine
and opposes them, it may be considered demoniacal. [784] and it is interesting to learn
from Baron Reinsberg,

[785] how, in several parts of Bohemia,
it is the custom on St James's Day to throw a he-goat out of the window,
and to preserve its blood, which is said to be of potent avail against
several diseases, such, for instance, as the spitting of blood. In the

[786] we also read that the he-goat's
blood was known by no less a name than

stone
Bezoar

[787]) analeptic and alexipharmic
virtues were supposed to exist, which were able to resist the evil
effects of poison and contagious diseases, the plague not excepted, and
to save the patient by causing an abundant and healthy perspiration to
break out on his skin. For this reason these stones were sold very dear. The same virtues are attributed to those found in the West, but in a
much less degree." When the heavenly goat dissolves in rain or in dew,
when moisture comes from the goat-cloud, the mountain-cloud, or the
stone-cloud, these humours are salutary. When St James, who is joined
with the goat and the rain, pours out his bottle, as the Piedmontese
people say, the vapour which falls from the sky on these days is
considered by the peasants, as in fact it is for the country, and
especially for the vines, a real blessing. In the fable of

[788] In the Witches' Sabbath in
Germany, it was

said
that the witches burned a he-goat, and divided its ashes among
themselves. [789]

The cunning she-goat is an intermediate form between the good wise
fairy and the witch who is an expert in every kind of malice. In the
same way as the hero, at first foolish, learns malice from the devil, to
use it afterwards against the devil himself, it may be presumed that the
hero, in his form of a goat, has learned from the monsters all that
cunning by which he afterwards distinguishes himself. The Vedic ram,
Indras, also uses magic against the monster magicians. In the second of the Esthonian stories, we read that the king of the
serpents has a golden cup containing the milk of a heavenly goat; if
bread is dipped into this milk, and put into the mouth, one can discover
every secret thing that has happened in the night, without any one
perceiving how. [790] the she-goat deceives the wolf in
a way similar to that in which, in the first number of

even
the simple one of "MangÃ© la fÃ¶ja" (to eat the leaf), meaning to
understand cunning. [791] I heard from a certain Uliva
Selvi, at Antignano (near Leghorn), the narrative of a witch who sent a
boy every day to take the she-goat to the pasturage, ordering him to pay
attention that it should eat well, but leave the corn alone. When the
goat returned, the witch asked it–

"Capra, mia capra Mergolla,

Come se' ben satolla?"

(Goat, my goat Mergolla,

Are you quite satiated?)

To which the goat answered–

"Son satolla e cavalcata,

Tutto il giorno digiunata."

(I am satiated, and have been ridden;

I have fasted all day.)

Then the boy was put to death by the witch. It happened thus to
twelve boys, until the thirteenth, more cunning, caressed the goat and
gave it the corn to eat; then the goat answered to the witch's
question–

"Son ben satolla e governata,

Tutto il giorno m' ha pasturata."

(I am quite satiated, and have been well
kept;

He has given me to eat all day.)

And the boy, too, was well treated. The devil's pupil always outwits his master; the she-goat beguiles
the wolf to its destruction. We have seen this in the Russian story, and
it is confirmed in the legend of Ysengrin. The peasants of
Piedmont and of
Sicily have, for this reason, so much respect for the goat, that they
consider it brings a blessing to the house near which it is maintained;
and if, by chance, they show a perverse nature, this perversity is
attributed to the devil himself, who, they believe, has maliciously
taken possession of them. A few years ago, a goatherd of the Val di
Formazza, in the Ossola in Piedmont, had two goats which he believed to
be possessed by some evil spirit, for which reason they always wandered
about, in order, as he thought, that the demon might at last be able to
throw them down some abyss. One day the two goats were lost; the
goatherd searched for them for a short time, but finding his search
bootless, he resolved to go and make a vow to the Madonna of Einsiedlen. Chance so arranged it, that at the very moment in which he was returning
from his pious pilgrimage, his two goats also approached the door of his
house; therefore, of course, this was declared to be a miracle in
Formazza, and as such it is still believed in that district.[792]

the
Vedic Indras is represented as a god-ram); he is, moreover, the
protector of marriages. Scandinavian mythology, therefore, appears to
regard the goat as essentially the one that makes fruitful, as a pluvial
cloud. In the Hindoo mythology of the brÃ¢hmanic period, the god Indras
loses, on the contrary, his divine power, becomes stupid and obscure,
and is lost in his form of a ram. In one of his

[793] In

But in the same way as the ass is the stupid patient animal, the ram
is the stupid quiet one. The he-goat is said to be an indifferent
husband, who allows his she-goats to be covered by other goats without
showing a sign of jealousy; hence our expressions, "horned goat," and
simply "horned," to indicate the husband of an unfaithful woman, that
is, of a woman who makes him
wear horns, like the goat, and the Italian proverb, "E meglio esser
geloso che becco" (it is better to be jealous than a he-goat). This
reputation, however, as assigned to the he-goat, is contrary to all that
has been said and written, and that is known concerning the lust of the
he-goat. On the contrary, Aristotle says explicitly that two he-goats,
which have always lived together in concord at the pasturage, fall out
and fight with violence in the time of coition. Moreover, the verse of
Pindaros is well known, in which he makes he-goats unite even with
women. It is also said that HermÃªs, or Zeus, assuming the form of a
he-goat, united himself with Penelope, whence was born the great
goat-footed satyr, Pan; that HÃªraklÃªs (as an ass, in his lion's skin)
competed with a he-goat in phallical powers (in Athenaios he joins
himself with fifty virgins in the space of seven nights); that, in
Ãlianos, a jealous he-goat punished with death the goatherd Crathis, who
had incestuously joined himself with one of his she-goats. Nevertheless,
the Greeks already called by the name of aix, as we Italians by
that of capra, a woman of an immoral life, or an adulteress. Columella gives us the key of the enigma, observing that the he-goat, by
abuse of the Venus, which he uses too soon (like the ass), becomes
powerless before the age of six years, so that it is not out of
indifference that he is simply a spectator of his she-goat's infidelity,
but only because he cannot do otherwise. Hence the application of
hircosus, which Plautus gives to an old man. It is the Hellenic tradition which, more than any other, developed to
a greater extent the myth of the goat and the sheep, under all their
aspects–demoniacal, divine, and hybrid. the
son of NephÃªlÃª (the cloud) and of Helle;

[794] Jupiter Ammon (in the fifth book
of Ovid's

whence the Greek geographer believed the fable of the golden fleece to
have arisen; the golden lamb kept by Atreus, which was to bring Thyestes

of Thyestes with his own daughter; Pan (with goat's feet, the son of the
he-goat Zeus or Hermes), who, in the fifth book of the

HermÃªs, called Krioforos, or carrier of a ram (that is, of a ram
which delivers the land from the plague, a form of St James); the two
predestined sheep which Epimenides sacrifices to make the Athenian
plague cease, in the twenty-seventh Olympiad, in Diogenes LaertÃªs; the
bleating goats that King Priam (in the fragments of Ennius) sacrifices
to dissipate the evil threatened by sinister dreams; the black sheep
sacrificed to Pluto, Proserpine, the Furies, and all the infernal
deities; the lamb, the ram, and the he-goat sacrificed to the genital
Fates in the Sybilline verses translated by Angelo Poliziano–

"Cum nox atra premit terram, tectusque latet
Sol;"

the white lamb sacrificed to Hercules, to Mars, to Jove, to Neptune,
to Bacchus, to Pan (the goat being sacrificed to Diana), to Apollo
(i.e., when the sun shines), to Ceres (the goddess of the
light-coloured ears of corn), to Venus, to the gods and goddesses; to
his divine forms (similia similibus); and several other mythical notions
(not to speak of the very popular legend relating to the goat Amalthea,
who nourished Zeus with her milk, and was by Zeus translated for this
service to the stars, under the name of Aixourania, or heavenly goat,
after he had taken off one of its horns, to give, in gratitude to the
two nymphs who had protected him, the
faculty of pouring out everything that was wished for);[796] all these account, in an eloquent
manner, for the wide-spread worship that the goat and the sheep
received, even in GrÃ¦co-Latin antiquity, enriching with many episodes
the mythical and legendary traditions of these nations, now as the type
of a god, now of a demon, and now of an intermediate being, such as the
satyr, for instance. In the same way as the mythical horse has, from evening to morning,
three conspicuous moments of action–black, grey, and white or red–and as
the mythical ass throws gold from behind and has golden ears, so the
mythical goat and sheep, which are dark-coloured in the night or in the
cloud, throw gold from behind and have golden horns which pour out
ambrosia, or else have even the cornucopia itself. It is always the same
myth of the cloudy and aqueous, of the nocturnal and tenebrous sky, with
its two glowing twilights or auroras, or else of the luminous heavenly
hero who traverses the night or the cloud (or the wintry season),
disguised in the shapes of various animals, now by his own will, now by
a divine malediction or by diabolical witchcraft. In the third book of Aristotle's History of Animals, we read
of the river Psikros in Thrace, that white sheep, when they drink of its
waters, bring forth black lambs;
that in Antandria there are two rivers, of which one makes the sheep
black, and the other white, and that the river Xanthos or Skamandros
makes the sheep fair (or golden). This belief involves in itself the
three transformations of the celestial hero into the three he-goats or
rams of different natures, of which we have spoken. The last
transformation calls our attention to the sheep with golden wool, the
golden lamb, and the Agnus Dei, the symbol of happiness, power
and riches. Wealth in sheep, even more than wealth in cows, became the
symbol of universal riches. The horn poured out every kind of treasure
upon the earth, and upon the earth itself the pecus became
pecunia. END OF VOL.
