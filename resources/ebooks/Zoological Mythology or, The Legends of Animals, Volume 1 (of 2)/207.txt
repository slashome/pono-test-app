180. [725] According to the
Annals of Padova, cited by Berrardino Scardeone, in Aldrovandi. De Quadrupedibus, i. [726] The German
proverb, "Wald hat Ohren, Feld hat Gesicht," is well known. Cfr. the
varieties of this proverb upon the ears of the forest, in the third vol. pp. 120 and 173, of Uhland's Schriften zur Geschichte der Dichtung
und Sage, StÃ¼ttgart, 1866. [727] The reader is
acquainted with the myth of the nymph Syrinx, beloved of Pan, who was
changed into a cane or reed, from which Pan made a flute. We find the
leaf of the cane in connection with the ass in Hungarian tradition. A
singular indentation can be observed upon the leaves of the cane, which
has a great resemblance to the mark of three teeth. To explain this
strange mark the Hungarian people narrate, that the ass of the Redeemer
once bit the leaf of a cane, but as Christ was in a hurry, the ass was
unable to eat the leaf, and so it happened that its three teeth only
left the mark of the bite upon the cane. From that time forward every
leaf of a cane bears record to this. The two lines which stretch down
the two flanks of the ass are said in Hungary to be caused by the blood
of our Redeemer. The popular belief in Ireland is that these lines
remain as a memorial of Christ having once struck the ass.–Cfr. the
chapter on the Peacock and that on the Eel, where we shall find the hero
and the heroine again transformed into canes. [728] The loss of
heart or courage is expressed in Italian by the low term "QuÃ­ mi casca
l'asino" (here my ass falls). This expression, however, may perhaps be
of Hellenic origin; the equivoque between the two equisonant
expressions, "ap' onou" and "apo nou" is well-known; whence to fall off
the ass and to fall from one's mind became synonymous. [729] There is an
unpublished story which I heard narrated at Antignano, near Leghorn, of
a mother who has a silly son named Pipetta.
