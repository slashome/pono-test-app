v. Abocellus, we read: "De quodam cÃ¦co
vaccarum custode," who, "quod colores et staturam vaccarum singularium
specialiter discerneret," was believed to be demoniacal; hence the
sacrament of confirmation was given him to deliver him from this
diabolical faculty, and the paper narrates that he was immediately
deprived of it. The blind hero who sees, who distinguishes his cows from
each other, is the sun in the cloud. No sooner does he receive
confirmation (which is a second baptism), than he ceases to see his
cows, for the simple reason that the clouds are dissolved in rain, or
that himself has recovered his vision. [464] Cfr. the papers
