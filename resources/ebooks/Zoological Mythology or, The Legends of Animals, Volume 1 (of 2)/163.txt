á¹igv. i. 182, 1. [590] As to the Vedic
passage, v. 76, 3, where it would seem that the AÃ§vinÃ¢u are invoked in
the morning, at midday, and in the evening, there seems to me to be room
for discussion. The text says: UtÃ¢ yÃ¢tam saÃ±gave prÃ¢tar ahno (that is,
in the early dawn, when the cows are gathered together), madhyandine
(which, in my mind, is the middle term which separates the gloomy hours
from the luminous ones), uditÃ¢ sÃ»ryasya (which, meaning the rising of
the sun, cannot express evening, but precisely the rising of the morning
sun). We too would have thus expressed the three moments in the morning
in which it was opportune to invoke the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. [591] SushupvÃ¢á¹saá¹ na
