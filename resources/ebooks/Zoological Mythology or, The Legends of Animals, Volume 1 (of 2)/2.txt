Jam vada Cephisi, Panopesque evaserat
arva;

Bos stetit; et, tollens spatiosam cornibus

Ad cÅ“lum frontem, mugitibus impulit
auras. Atque ita, respiciens comites sua terga
sequentes,

herba."

This is the good fairy, or good old man, who shows the way to the
heroes in popular tales; it is the cow which succours the maiden
persecuted by her step-mother, the puppet which spins, sews, and weaves
for the maiden aurora. For just as we have seen that the wooden girl is
the aurora herself, which at morn comes out of, and at even
re-enters, the forest of night,[507] as is clearly shown by the myths
of UrvaÃ§Ã® and of Daphne, so in like manner the moon comes out of and
re-enters the nocturnal forest, transforming herself from a tree to a
cow, and from a cow to a tree, wooden girl, or puppet. Some myths
relating to the aurora are also applicable to the moon, on account of
the resemblance of the phenomena (the lunar and solar bulls also are
interchangeable), as they both come out of the nocturnal gloom, both
drop dewy humours, and both run after the sun, of which the aurora is
the deliverer in the morning, and the moon the protectress, guide,
hostess, and good advising fairy, who teaches him the secret by which to
avoid the ambuscades of the monster. HÃªraklÃªs passes the sea upon the
neck of the cow-moon; but instead of the cow, we also find in the
mythical sky of HÃªraklÃªs the golden cup, which is the same thing. From
the cow-moon comes forth the horn of abundance; from the cornucopia to
the cup the passage is easy. It is said that HÃªraklÃªs, approaching the
oxen of Geryon, the West, felt himself burned by the sun's rays, and
shot arrows at him (in the same way as Indras in the á¹igvedas
breaks a wheel of the car of SÃ»ryas, the sun). The sun admires the
courage and strength of the hero, and lends him his golden cup, upon
which HÃªraklÃªs passes the sea. This being accomplished, HÃªraklÃªs
restores the cup to the sun, and finds the oxen. is
preserved. The cow which helps the maiden becomes, as we have already
seen, an apple-tree, and helps her again in this form. We find the same
myth transformed in Greece. In

[508] we read, "Cum rustici quidam
Herculi Alexicaco bovem essent immolaturi, isque rupto fune profugisset
(the bull destined to the sacrifice repairs to the forest of night), nec
esset quod sacrificaretur, malum arreptum suppositis quatuor ramis
crurum vice, deinde additis alteris duobus ceu cornuum loco, bovem
utcumque fuisse imitatos, idque ridiculum simulacrum pro victima
sacrificasse Herculi." This account is confirmed by the facts recorded
by Julius Pollux,

[509] that the apple-tree was sacrificed
to HÃªraklÃªs. The moon, on account of its circular form, assumed, besides
the figure of a pea, a pumpkin and a cabbage, also that of a golden
apple. As it contains honey, the sweet apple represents well the
ambrosial moon. Moreover, in the same way as we have seen the pea which
fell on the ground become a tree, and rise to heaven, so the apple
became an apple-tree, the tree of golden apples found in the Western
garden of the Hesperides. The moon, besides the form of a horned cow, also assumed, in the
popular Ãryan belief, that of a tart, of a cake, either on account of
its circular shape, or of the ambrosial honey supposed to be contained
by the moon, because of the dew or rain which it spreads on the ground. The cake has in Slavonic tradition the same importance as the pea,
kidney-bean, or cabbage. The bull or cow of the fool, bartered for a
pea, is perhaps the same as the sun or aurora of evening, bartered
during the night for the moon, or else meeting the moon. The funereal
pea or
kidney-bean, the vegetable which serves as provision for the journey in
the kingdom of the dead, and which brings the hero riches, is perhaps
only the moon, which the solar hero finds on the way during the night,
and which he receives in exchange for his cow's hide. When the hero
possesses this pea, he is assured of every kind of good fortune, and can
enter or ascend into the luminous sky, as well as come out of the gloomy
hell, into which the monster has drawn him. A similar virtue is
attributed to the cake, which we find in Indo-European funeral customs
instead of the vegetable of the dead. After this we can understand what Plutarch tells us in the Life of
Lucullus concerning the Cyziceni, of whom he writes, that, pressed by
siege, they offered up to Proserpine (the moon in hell) a cow of black
paste, not being able to offer up one of flesh; and he adds, that the
sacrifice was agreeable to the goddess. Thus, in the thirty-sixth fable
of Ãsop, we read of an invalid who promises to the gods that he will
sacrifice a hundred oxen to them in the event of a cure; when cured, as
he does not possess a hundred oxen of flesh, he makes a hundred of
paste, and burns them upon the hearth. But, according to Ãsop, the gods
were not satisfied, and endeavoured to play off a joke upon him; an
attempt, which, however, did not succeed, inasmuch as the cunning man
used it to his own profit; for the solar hero in the night, not being
really a fool, merely feigns to be one. But, to return to the cow-moon: we must complete the explanation of
another myth, that of the excrement of the cow considered as purifying. The moon, as the aurora, yields ambrosia; it is considered to be a cow;
the urine of this cow is ambrosia or holy water; he who drinks this
water purifies himself, as the ambrosia which
rains from the lunar ray and the aurora cleans the paths of the sky,
purifies and makes clear (dÃ®rghaya Äakshase) the paths of the
sky which the shadows of night darken and contaminate. The same virtue
is attributed, moreover, to cow's dung, a conception also derived from
the cow, and given to the moon as well as to the morning aurora. These
two cows are conceived as making the earth fruitful by means of their
ambrosial excrements; these excrements, being also luminous, both those
of the moon and those of the aurora are considered as purifiers. The
ashes of these cows (which their friend the heroine preserves) are not
only ashes, but golden powder or golden flour (the golden cake occurs
again in that flour or powder of gold which the witch demands from the
hero in Russian stories), which, mixed with excrement, brings good
fortune to the cunning and robber hero. The ashes of the sacrificed
pregnant cow (i.e., the cow which dies after having given birth
to a calf) were religiously preserved by the Romans in the temple of
Vesta, with bean-stalks (which are used to fatten the earth sown with
corn), as a means of expiation. Ovid[510] mentions this rite:–

"Nox abiit, oriturque Aurora. Palilia poscor,

Non poscor frustra, si favet alma Pales. Alma Pales, faveas pastoria sacra
canenti;

Prosequor officio si tua festa pio. Certe ego de vitulo cinerem, stipulasque
fabales,

SÃ¦pe tuli plena februa casta, manu."

The ashes of a cow are preserved both as a symbol of resurrection and
as a means of purification. As to the excrements of the cow, they are
still used to form the
so-called eau de millefleurs, recommended by several
pharmacopÅ“ias as a remedy for cachexy.[511]

lion
(HÃªraklÃªs, Samson); as a golden-horned hero, he is a very strong bull;
enclosed in the cloud, they roar and bellow. The two images of the
sun-lion and of the sun-bull are now in harmony and now in discordance,
and fight with one another. In the

[512] In yet another Ãsopian fable taken
from Syntipa, the bull kills the lion, while asleep, with his horns. In
PhÃ¦drus, the wild boar with his tusks, the bull with his horns, and the
ass with kicks, put an end to the old and infirm lion. In PhÃ¦drus's
fable of the ox and the ass drawing together, the ox falls inert upon
the ground when he loses his horns. Aristoteles, in the third book on
the Parts of Animals, censures the Momos of Ãsop, who laughs at the bull
because he has his horns on his forehead instead of on his arms, showing
that if the bull had his horns on

any
other part of his body, they would be a useless weight, and would impede
his other functions without aiding him in anything. The ox and the lion
were also painted together in Christian churches. [513]

To continue the legend of the solar hero and the oxen, we find again
in HÃªraklÃªs, as employed among the herds in the service of King Augeias,
the sun, the usual hostler-hero; he is not only to guard the herds well,
but in one day to cleanse them thoroughly, and make them shine. Defrauded of the price by Augeias, he kills him, and ravages all his
country. In the same way, in Homer, Apollo guards, for a stipulated
price, the herds of King Laomedon upon Mount Ida, and is cheated of his
reward. In the same way, Hermes takes the herds of King Admetos to
pasture; he leads them to browse near the herds of Apollo, from whom he
steals a hundred bulls and twelve cows, preventing the dogs from barking
(as HÃªraklÃªs does when he leads away Geryon's oxen). This Hermes, this
god Mercury, god of merchants, this merchant and robber, is the same as
the skilful and cunning thief of the stories who carries off horses,
draught oxen, caskets, and ear-rings from the king; he is the
hero-thief; but a shade distinguishes him from the monster brigand or
Vedic demoniacal Paá¹is; the hero who hides himself and the monster that
hides things both do a furtive action. When Hermes leads away the herds
stolen from the solar god, the sun, he also takes care to fasten
branches of trees to their tails, which, by sweeping the road, shall
destroy the track of the bulls and cows that have been led away. The
shepherd Battos plays the spy, although, as the price of his silence,
Hermes has promised him a white cow (the moon, and perhaps
Battos himself, the spy, is the moon). Hermes tests him, by disguising
himself and promising him a bull and a cow if he speaks. Battos speaks,
and Hermes punishes him by transforming him into a stone:–

"Vertit

In durum silicem, qui nunc quoque dicitur
index."[514]

[515] who inhabits in the Aventine
forest a cavern full of human bones (like the monster of fairy tales);
who thunders (flammas ore sonante vomit), who fights with rocks and
trunks of trees, in Ovid

[516] (like the heroes in the Hindoo,
Slavonic, German, and Homeric tradition); who steals the cows from
HÃªraklÃªs, and hides their footprints by dragging them backwards into the
cavern, in Livy; who also tells us that the cows in the cavern low,
wishing for the bulls from whom they are separated (as in the Vedic
hymns). The hero, hearing them, finds the cavern, overturns with a great
noise the rock which five pair of oxen yoked together could scarcely
have moved (like the Marutas who break the rock, like Indras who splits
the crag open), and with the three-knotted club (trinodis) kills the
monster and frees the cows. The solar hero who at evening leads away
oxen or cows, or who at morning steals them from the stable, is a
skilful robber who has acted meritoriously,

and
marries, in reward, the princess aurora; the cloudy or gloomy monster
who steals the solar cows to shut them up in the cavern, whence he then
throws out smoke and flames, is an infamous criminal. The divine thief
steals almost out of playfulness, either to show his craftiness or to
prove his valour; the demoniacal thief steals because of his malevolent
character, and instinct to devour what he steals, as does the fabled
worm of the river Indus (the Vedic Sindhus, or heavenly ocean), who
draws into the abyss and devours the thirsty oxen who go to drink. [517]

[518] and makes stones and plants
tremble, that is, makes stones and plants move, especially celestial
ones (

[519] that Dionysos gives a bull in
reward to Ãagros, who has won in the competition of song and of the
lyre, whilst he reserves a hirsute he-goat for him who loses; on this
account we find on the capitals of columns in old Milanese churches,
calves and bulls represented as playing on the lyre. [520] It is a variation of the myth of
the ass and the lyre, which has the same meaning. The bull and the ass,
for the same reason, are found represented together, because they bellow
and bray (like Christian

Corybantes)
near the cradle of the new-born god, in order to hide, by their noise,
his birth from the old king or deity who is to be dethroned. [521] The conch of BhÃ®mas, the
elephant-horn of Orlando, the Greek war-bugle tauraia, by means of which
armies were moved, derived their character and their name from the
mythical bull, the thundering god. The voice of the bull is compared in
Euripides to the voice of Zeus;

[522] the music which pleases the heroes
is certainly not the air of the

[523] the roar of the lion, the
bellowing of the bull, who occupies the first place in the heavens, and
has occupied us so long, because the supreme god took his form, after
having carried off EurÃ´pÃª. Zeus left on the earth his divine form, and
the more generally preferred heroic form of a bull took him up to
heaven:–

"Litoribus tactis stabat sine cornibus ullis

Juppiter, inque deum de bove versus erat. Taurus init cÅ“lum."[524]

We thus, after a long pilgrimage in the fields of tradition, return
to the Vedic bull Indras, from whom we started, and to his female form,
which, having a human nature, became a cow, and being a cow, assumed a
divine shape:–

"QuÃ¦ bos ex homine, ex bove facta Dea."[525]

The myth of the horse is perhaps not so rich in legends as that of
the bull and the cow, but certainly no less interesting. As the horseman
is the finest type of the hero, so the horse which carries him is in
mythology the noblest of animals. [526] and they are very probably
identical with the two fair-haired, amiable, splendid, and ardent
coursers of Indras, of Savitar (the sun), and proper and worthy to bear
heroes,

[527] who yoke themselves

at a
word,

[528] are maned, adapted to make
fruitful, full of life,

[529] having eyes like the sun,

[530] made by the á¹ibhavas,

[531] who, as they made the cow out of a
cow, also made a horse out of the horse,

[532] black, with white feet, drawing
the chariot with the golden yoke, revealing the beings;

[533] the two rapid ones; the two most
rapid ones;

[534] plunging into the inebriating
drink before Indras yokes them;

[535] beautiful, by means of which the
chariot of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u is as swift as thought;

[536] who carry Indras, as every day
they carry the sun;

[537] are the two rays of the sun;

[538] who neigh, dropping ambrosia;

[539] the very pure horses of the bull
Indras, inebriated, who illumine the sky,

[540] with manes the colour of a
peacock,

[541] bridled sixty times (properly six
times twice five);

[542] beneficent, winged, indefatigable,
resolute destroyers (of the enemies). [543] The

marriage
of Somas and SÃ»ryÃ¢, is drawn by mules, and the aurora by red cows (or
bulls), teaches us that Indras is drawn by horses, and the AÃ§vinÃ¢u by
asses; the AÃ§vinÃ¢u carried off the prize. [544] In the

[545] we find another important
circumstance,

[546] mules are sung of as being better
adapted than oxen to draw the plough. The
mythical horse of the Hungarians, the horse TÃ¡tos, or TÃ¡tos lo, when
born, is of an ugly aspect, defective and lean; it is therefore said in
Hungarian, that "the TÃ¡tos comes out of a defective horse." It is,
however, always born with teeth,

[547] although its chin is sometimes
wanting; its bursts out of a black pentagonal egg on an Ash Wednesday,
after the hero has carried it for seven summers and seven winters under
his arm. In the

[548] the first created horse
UÄÄÃ¢iá¸¥Ã§ravas, the king of the horses (and therefore the horse of
Indras), which is as swift as thought, follows the path of the sun, and
is luminous and white, has, however, a black tail, made so by the magic
of the serpents, who have covered it with black hairs. This is probably
the black ass's or horse's tail which remains upon the ugly or wicked
sister's forehead, in the popular European story of the two
sisters. [549] It must also be remarked that, as
the word

In the same way, therefore, as the hero of popular tales before
becoming a wise man is generally an ass, the animal ridden by the solar
hero, prior to being a real and noble horse, is usually a worthless
jade, or a dark-coloured ass. The sun, in the beginning of the night,
rides a black horse, and afterwards a grey one, or else an ass or a
mule, but in the morning, on the contrary, a white and luminous horse,
which has a black tail; or else the dark horse of night has a white
head, or white legs, or anterior parts of the body, with golden ears,
and the nape of the neck formed of pearls.[550] The monstrous Trojan horse too, of
Epeios, a figure which represents the horse of mythology, in
TryphiodÃ´ros the Egyptian,[551] has a golden mane, red eyes, and
silver teeth. In the Turkish stories of Siberia,[552] it is upon an iron-coloured horse
that the third brother, hated by his father and his two elder brothers,
advances against the demon Ker Iutpa. The hero becomes the excrement of
a horse, and the horse a crow; the former glues the monster's lower lip
to the earth, the latter suspends his upper lip to the sky. In order
better to understand this strange myth, we must remember that the name
of one of the Valkiries is "Mist," a word which means excrement and fog. The fog, or frost, or rain, or dew, falls to the ground; the
solar horse, or the sun, rises in the sky; the monster of night or of
clouds is dispersed. In the thirteenth Esthonian story of Kreutzwald, the third
brother comes three times to deliver the princess from the mountain of
glass (or ice), where she sleeps. The first time he is dressed the
colour of bronze, upon a bronze-coloured horse; the second time dressed
in silver, upon a horse the colour of silver; and the third time upon a
gold-coloured horse, dressed in gold. In an unpublished Piedmontese story, the young prince, whose beloved
princess has been ravished beyond seas, is borne over the waves by an
eagle, which he feeds with his own flesh. Arrived beyond the sea, he
hears that the princess is destined to be the wife of the hero who wins
the race three times; the first time he appears dressed in black, upon a
black horse; the second time dressed in white, upon a white horse; and
the third time dressed in red, upon a red horse. Each time he wins the
race, and thereafter receives the beautiful princess in marriage. [553] it then becomes the grey horse of
the giantess, the grey horse which smells the dead hero Sigurd in the

[554] an expression which reminds me of
the

Aruá¹as,
charioteer of the sun (or even the brother of the sun himself, inasmuch
as he is the brother of Garuá¸as, the solar bird), is said to be born
with an imperfect body;

[555] he can be luminous and divine only
in part. The black horse, on the contrary, has generally an evil and
demoniacal nature; the black horse corresponds to the black devil; the
colour black itself is, according to popular superstition, the product
of bad humours. [556] Every horse, when born, has,
according to Maestro Agostino, a piece of black flesh upon its lips,
called hippomanes by the Greeks: "La quale carne dici lo vulgo essere
molto sospettosa a li maleficii." Maestro Agostino adds, moreover, that
the mother refuses to give suck to the colt as long as it carries this
piece of flesh upon its lips, and some say that the mother herself eats
it. In an idyll of Theokritos, we read that the Hippomanes is born among
the Arcadians, and maddens colts and swift mares. [557] In the first chapter we mentioned
the Russian

[558] and to it can probably be traced
the

custom,
still observed by many grooms, of leaving a lamp lighted in the stable
during the night. The devil, as is well known, is afraid of the light
(Agnis is called rakshohan, or monster-killer), and his black horse
likewise. It is therefore a sinister omen, according to two verses in

[559] to dream of black horses, whilst,
on the contrary, it is a good omen to dream of white ones. In the Norman
legend of the priest Walchelm, a black horse presents itself to him in
the first days of January of the year 1091, and tempts him to mount upon
its back; scarcely has Walchelm done so, than the black horse sets off
for hell. [560] The dead, too, according to the
popular belief, often ride upon black or demoniacal horses. [561]

A well-known Russian story in verse, the Kaniok Garbunok, or
Little Hump-backed Horse, of Jershoff, commences thus:–An old
man has three sons, the youngest of which is the usual Ivan DurÃ¡k, or
Ivan the fool. The old man finds his corn-field devastated every
morning; he wishes to find out who the devastator is, and sends his
first-born son to watch the first night. The first-born has drunk too
much, and falls asleep, and so does the second son, and from the same
cause, on the second night. On the third night it is Ivan's turn to
watch;
he does not fall asleep. At midnight he sees a mare which breathes
flames coming. Ivan ties her by a rope, leaps upon her, seizes her by
the mane, torments and subdues her, until the mare, to be let free,
promises to give Ivan one of her young ones, and carries him to the
stable where her three young ones are. She gives Ivan a little
hump-backed horse with long ears (the Hindoo UÄÄÃ¢iá¸¥sravas), that flies. By means of this little hump-backed horse, Ivan will make his fortune;
when he leads it away, the mare and the two other colts follow it. Ivan's two brothers steal the mare and two colts, and go to sell them to
the Sultan. Ivan rejoins them, and the three brothers stay in the
Sultan's service as grooms; sometime afterwards, Ivan saves himself from
drowning by means of his horse. In the third of Erlenwein's Russian stories, a stallion is
born to the Tzar's mare, that had drunk the water in which a certain
fish (a pike, in the nineteenth story) had been washed, at the same time
as the Tzar's daughter and her maid give birth to two heroes, Ivan
TzareviÄ and Ivan DieviÄ–i.e., John of the Tzar and John of the
girl, a form representing the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. Ivan TzareviÄ rides upon the
stallion. In the nineteenth story, the son of the mare is called
Demetrius of the Tzar (Dmitri TzareviÄ); hero and horse being
identified. In the fifth story of Erlenwein, a Cossack goes
into the forest, where he is betrayed into the enemy's hands, who gives
orders that he be cut in pieces, put into a sack, and attached to his
horse. The horse starts, and carries him to the house of silver and
gold, where he is resuscitated. During the following night, an old man
and woman, whose guest the Cossack is, drag him, in order to waken him,
by the cross which hangs on his neck, and he is thus transformed into a
horse of gold and silver. Towards evening, the horse, by the
Tzar's order, is killed, and (like the bull and the cow) becomes an
apple-tree of silver and gold. The apple-tree is cut down, and becomes a
golden duck. The golden duck is the same as the golden horse, or as the
hero resuscitated, i.e., the morning sun. The sack and the
horse which carry the hero cut in pieces represent the voyage of the sun
in the gloom of night, or the voyage of the grey horse, the imperfect
horse, the bastard mule, or the ass. In the Russian tales, moreover, a distinction is made between the
grey and the black horse; the grey horse helps the hero in the night
very effectively, and the black one, on the contrary, is the herald of
death. When, in the ninth story of Erlenwein, the horse of Ivan
the merchant's son goes to search for the horses of the princess from
beyond the sea, Ivan waits for him upon the shore. If he sees grey
horses come forth, it is to be a sign that his own steed is alive; but
if, on the other hand, black horses appear, he is to conclude that his
own horse is dead. Grey is the colour of sadness, black is the colour of
death. In Afanassieff, we find new interesting data. Ivan the fool
watches during the night to surprise the horse which devastates his
father's crops, and succeeds in binding it with rods from a linden-tree,
after it has smelt the odour of tobacco. Then, by the help of the sister
of the hero Nikanore, it acquires the faculty, when running after cows
and horses, of turning their tails into gold, as well as their horns or
manes, and their flanks into stars. What better image could there be of
the starry sky of night, the golden tail of which is the red evening,
and the front parts, also of gold, the morning aurora?[562]

In another story,[563] we have Ivan the son of the bitch
occupying
the place and playing the part of Ivan the son of the mare. Ivan of the
bitch, after having delivered the three princesses from the deep
cistern, is himself thrown into it. The black horse comes to deliver
him, and cannot; the grey horse comes, and cannot either; the red horse
comes, and succeeds in dragging the hero out. The black horse represents
the dark night, the grey horse the night beginning to clear, and the red
horse the roseate morning, which delivers the sun or solar hero. The third brother Ivan, mounted on a marvellous horse, comes first to
the bronze castle, then to the silver one, and lastly to that of
gold.[564] This is a variety of the same
myth, and represents similarly the solar voyage from evening to morning. The next mythical legend, however, probably alludes rather to the three
days of the winter solstice, which the sun takes to return. The hero,
Theodore, finds a horse that has been just brought forth, which the
wolves have driven towards him; he makes it pasture upon the dew for
three dawns (like the Hungarian TÃ¡tos, who feeds upon the golden oats in
a silver field, that is to say, who, during the silvery night, or else
during the white dawn, or the snowy winter, absorbs the dewy humours of
the spring, or the morning aurora). The first day, the young horse
becomes as high as half a tree; the second, higher than the tree; the
third day it is as high as the heavens, and bears the hero Theodore and
his wife Anastasia on its back. Ivan DurÃ¡k watches three nights at his father's tomb.[565] His father tells him that if at
any time of need he calls with a hero's whistle, a wonderful grey horse
will appear to help him, whose eyes shoot flames, and from whose
nostrils issues smoke. Ivan does so, and is answered; he gets
into his right ear, and comes out of the left. By means of this horse,
Ivan succeeds in taking down the portrait of the Tzar's daughter three
times, though hung high up on the wall of the palace, and thus obtains
the beautiful princess to wife. According to another variety of this story,[566] Ivan, the third and foolish
brother, goes with the most worthless jade in the stable into the open
air, and calls up the grey horse with a loud shout; he enters into him
by one ear, and comes out at the other. Two young horsemen (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u)
appear to him, and make a horse with golden mane and tail come forth;
upon this horse Ivan succeeds in three times kissing, through twelve
glasses (the glass mountain of the Esthonian story), the daughter of the
Tzar, who therefore becomes his wife. Here, therefore, we find the ugly
horse which is made beautiful by the two horsemen, represented by the
two ears of the grey horse out of which they come. These two horsemen
give the hero a better steed. Be it understood that their own heroic
steed (that is, the sun's horse), from being ugly or asinine during the
night, became beautiful and noble; in the KÃ¼llaros of the Dioscuri, too,
we ought probably to recognise a courser that has been transformed from
an ass to a heroic horse. Sometimes, instead of the horse, we have only its head. The
step-mother persecutes the old man's daughter;[567] the persecuted
maiden finds a mare's head, which beseeches her to relieve and cover it;
at last it invites her to enter the right ear and come out of the left
one. The persecuted girl comes out in the form of an exceedingly
beautiful maiden. The step-mother sends her own daughter to try the same
means of becoming beautiful; but she maltreats the mare's head, and the
mare's head devours her. [568] When the day begins to appear,
BasiliÃ§a sees before her a white horseman, dressed all in white, upon a
white horse, caparisoned in white. The maiden goes on; when the sun
begins to rise, she sees a red horseman, dressed in red, upon a red
horse. [569] The myth does not require comment;
but it happens to be given to us in the story itself by the witch, who,
to appease the curiosity of the girl BasiliÃ§a, reveals to her that the
black

horseman
represents the dark night (noÄ tiÃ³mnaja), the white horseman the clear
day (dien jasnoi), and the red horseman the little red sun (solnishko
krasnoje). Returning from Slavonic to Asiatic tradition, we meet with the same
myths. [570] But this is not enough; the

[571] Rebhas and BhuÇµyus are two names
of the hero

who
falls into the cistern in the

[572] Here the grey and imperfect horse
of night is become a red horse. In the same Vedic hymn, Rebhas,
overwhelmed in the waters, is identified with his own horse (Ivan is son
of the bitch, or the cow, or the mare), he being compared to a horse
hidden by wicked ones. [573]

We
saw above, in the Russian story, how the two horsemen who come out of
the grey horse's ear give to the foolish Ivan, who has an ugly and
worthless horse, a handsome hero's palfrey, by means of which he
accomplishes the arduous undertakings which entitle him to the hand of
the king's daughter. It is remarkable how completely the Vedic myth
agrees with this European legend. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u have given, for his
eternal happiness, a luminous horse to him who has a bad one. [574] In another hymn, the god Agnis
gives to his worshipper a pious, truthful, invincible, and very glorious
son, who vanquishes heroes, and a swift, victorious, and unconquered
horse. [575]

[576] of the very vast step
(urukramishá¹­aá¸¥),

[577] who, in three steps, measured or
traversed the whole span of the heavens,

[578] betrays in another hymn the secret
of Vishá¹us's success in this divine enterprise, since it says that when,
with the strength of Indras, he made his three steps, he was drawn by
the two fair-haired horses

of
Indras

[579] (that is, the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u lent him
the swift and strong horse which was to bear him on to victory). The
three steps of Vishá¹us correspond, therefore, to the three stations of
Ivan, to the three races of the young hero to win the beautiful
princess. Vishá¹us also appears in the

[580] in the midst of the sea of
liquified butter, attractive to all beings, in the form of a horse's
head. Hero and the solar or lunar horse are identified. [581] By means of the horse obtained
from the two horsemen, the Russian Ivan acquires his wife; in the

[582] The horses of the sun are so fully
identified with the chariot drawn by them, that they are said to be
dependent on it, united with it, and almost born of it. [583] The AÃ§vinÃ¢u, therefore, by means
of the horse now enable the wife to be found by the solar hero, by the
old Äyavanas made young again (TithÃ´n),

[584] now by the sun, and now find her
themselves (perhaps drawing the chariot like horses). RÃ¢mas, too, who is
represented in the

[585] as the deliverer of SÃ®tÃ¢, is
compared to the solar horse, to the sun born upon the mountain. We
have seen in the Russian stories how the horse's head possesses the same
magic power as the marvellous horse which the two horsemen give to the
hero Ivan. Thus, in the Vedic myth, and in the corresponding brÃ¢hmanic
tradition, the horse's head DadhyaÅÄ stands in direct relation with the
myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. The wise DadhyaÅÄ shows himself pious towards the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u, to whom, although he knows that he will pay with his head for
the revelation he makes, he communicates what he knows concerning the
ambrosia or the MadhuvidyÃ¢. For this, accordingly, DadhyaÅÄ forfeits his
head; but the AÃ§vinÃ¢u present him with a horse's head (his own), which
heroically achieves wonders. With the bones of DadhyaÅÄ, or with the
head of the horse DadhyaÅÄ (he who walks in butter or ambrosia), fished
up in the ambrosial lake Ãaryaá¹Ã¢vat (the head of the horse Vishá¹us in
the sea of butter),

[586] Indras discomfits the ninety-nine
hostile monsters (as Samson the Philistines with the jawbone of an
ass). [587] This exchange of heads seems to be
common to the traditions which are founded upon the myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u,
that is, to the legends of the two brother or companion heroes. In the

[588] the heads of the prince and of the
BrÃ¢hman, who are exceedingly like each other, are cut off and then
fastened on

again;
but, by some mistake, the head of the one is attached to the body of the
other, so that the prince's wife is embarrassed between them. This
exchange of the husband (which corresponds to the exchange of the wife
in the legend of Berta, referred to in the first chapter) is very
frequent in the legend of the two brothers, and often ends in the
rupture of the perfect concord reigning between them. The two brothers
or companions who dispute about the wife, is a variety of the legend of
the three brothers who, having delivered the beautiful princess, wish to
divide her between them. The á¹igvedas does not seem as yet explicitly to exhibit the
two AÃ§vinÃ¢u at discord–they generally are united in doing good; but as
we already know the Vedic blind man and lame man who are cured by the
grace of Indras, or of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u themselves; as we know that the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u, in the á¹igvedas, make DadhyaÅÄ, who has a horse's
head, conduct them to the ambrosia, or indicate where it is, probably in
order that they may procure health and strength for themselves; as in
the ninth strophe of the 117th hymn of the first book of the
á¹igvedas, the marvellous horse of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, which kills the
monster-serpent (ahihan), is but one; as we know that the AÃ§vinÃ¢u run to
gain the bride for themselves; and as we cannot ignore the fact that in
the story of the blind and lame man, when a woman comes upon the scene,
they endeavour to do harm to each other; as we know that of the two
Hellenic brothers, the Dioscuri, one alone had from the gods the gift of
immortality; as, finally, it is known to us that of the two brothers, he
alone is the true hero who, by means of his horse, gains the victory
over the monster,–it is clear that if we have not as yet in the
á¹igvedas the myth of the two brothers at discord, we have, at
least, in the ambrosia, and in the
bride won by them the origin of the myth already indicated; and from the
idea of the privileged brother that of the envious one would naturally
arise. In Hesiod's Theogony we have the two brothers ChrysÃ¤or and
PÃªgasos, that come out of the Medusa (the evening aurora), who is made
pregnant by PoseidÃ´n, after Perseus has cut off her head. PÃªgasos, the
younger brother, becomes the heroic horse. In Hesiod himself, and in the
Metamorphoses of Ovid, he carries the thunder and the
thunderbolts for Zeus. The hero Bellerophontes rides him, and
vanquishes, by his help, the Chimaira and the Amazons; he becomes the
horse of the aurora, the horse of the Muses, the ambrosial steed. The
monstrous Chimaira appears, in the Theogony of Hesiod, as the
daughter of Typhaon and the Echidna, the monstrous daughter of ChrysÃ¤or. Therefore in the conflict which Bellerophontes maintains against the
Chimaira, we have a form of the battle which goes on between the twin
horses PÃªgasos and ChrysÃ¤or, the one divine, the other demoniacal. In the analogous myth of the Hellenic Dioscuri (the sons of the
luminous one, i.e., of Zeus, just as the Vedic AÃ§vinÃ¢u are the
sons of the luminous sky;[589] Zeus is united with the Dioscuri,
as Indras is with the AÃ§vinÃ¢u), we again find the twins who fight to
recover a woman who had been carried off from them, i.e., their
own sister Helen. One of the two brothers is mortal, and the other
immortal; he who is immortal passes the night in hell with his mortal
brother. The double aspect of the sun, which at evening enters and loses
itself in the night, now black, now illumined by the moon, and which, in
the morning, comes forth in a luminous form, has enriched the
story of the two brothers of mythology. One of the two brothers, the red
horseman, is in especial relation with the morning sun; the other, in
intimate connection with the silvery moon, the white horseman, and when
the latter is amissing, with the infernal gloom. [590] Of the twin-brothers, one is
always imperfect; the lunar crepuscular light offers us a similar
imperfection, with respect to the sun. Inasmuch as the AÃ§vinÃ¢u are
affiliated both to the sun and the moon, when they come out of the two
ears of the horse of night, we should understand, it would appear, that
on one side the moon goes down, while on the other the sun is born, or
that the solar horse arises, upon which the young hero lost in the night
mounts and wins the princess aurora. In the Russian stories referred to
in the preceding chapter, we have seen how the maiden abandons her
hero-husband, or brother, to give herself into the monster's hands; the
evening aurora forsakes the sun to throw herself into the night, and the
evening twilight stays for a long time with the evening aurora

(the
reddish sky of evening), when the sun is already gone. In the morning
the two lovers, the twilight, or sun and moon, and the aurora, meet once
more; when the sun, or solar hero, arrives, he surprises them

the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u can only occupy the place of paranymphs. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u, therefore,
would appear to be excluded from the wedding of SÃ»ryÃ¢ as principal
personages; they would seem to be nothing more than assistants, and, in
fact, they often assume this part in the Vedic hymns, by enabling now
the bride to find a husband, now the husband to recover his bride. We
know already that by means of them Äyavanas, the old sun (a Vedic
TithÃ´n), became young again, and was able to espouse the aurora. We know
that they gave sight to Vandanas (properly, the Face), that they made
the blind see,

[591] the lame walk, and performed
sundry other works of charity, which would, however, have been much more
glorious if these acts did not, in fact, always issue in benefit to
themselves, as blind, lame, or drowned. It is hence very probable that
when they give a bride to the hero, they, being now lunar, now solar
heroes, do only appropriate her to themselves. When, therefore, we read
that the AÃ§vinÃ¢u assist as paranymphs at the nuptials of SÃ»ryÃ¢ and
Somas, we are much inclined to think that under Somas in this case one
of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u is hidden. In Indras and Somas, often sung of together in
the

[592] and because they are invoked
together against the yÃ¢tudhÃ¢nas, which, by the grace of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the
hero Rebhas succeeds in discovering and then chasing away. [593] The

[594] represents to us the daughter of
the sun (SÃ¢vitrÃ®) by the name of SÃ®tÃ¢, as enamoured of Somas, who, on
the contrary, loves another woman, the ÃraddhÃ¢ (

[595] already notices that the AÃ§vinÃ¢u
were identified now with the day and the night,

[596] now with the sun and the moon. [597] we must interpret the passage with
discrimination, and conclude that one of

them
was sometimes preferred, inasmuch as the Vedic nuptial hymn speaks of
only one husband of SÃ»ryÃ¢, with the name of Somas, with whom, as we have
said, YÃ¢skas identifies one of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. We read in

An evidently Hindoo variation of this myth is contained in the
well-known episode of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, which relates the
adventures of Sundas and Upasundas, two inseparable brothers, who lived
together in love and concord, each being ruled by the will of the other,
and who had never all their lives either said or done anything to
displease each other. The gods become envious of their virtue, and wish
to prove it, and send to seduce them a nymph of enchanting beauty. The
two brothers, on seeing her, desire each the exclusive possession of the
divine maiden, and strive between themselves to carry her off. They
fight so long and so desperately that they both die (the moon and the
sun see the aurora in the morning, and dispute for her; they see her
again in the evening, and fight so long that they both perish miserably,
and die in the night). The gods who are envious of the virtue of the two
brothers Sundas and Upasundas, are the same as those who, envying the
good which the AÃ§vinÃ¢u do to
mankind, treat them as celestial ÃudrÃ¢s, under the pretext that they
pollute themselves by their contact with men, and refuse to admit them,
being impure, to the sacrifices.[598]

[599] The mortal brother, he who has to
remain in hell, and who has to fight the monsters of night, is Castor
the horseman. Pollux, the strong-armed, is, on the contrary, the
immortal one, the daily sun, he who profits from the victory obtained by
his brother who has fought in the night, during which the GandharvÃ¢s
(the horses in the perfumes, they who walk in perfume) also ride upon
war-horses, heroic, invulnerable, divine, exceedingly swift, who change
colour at will–the GandharvÃ¢s, whose strength increases during the
night, as one of them informs ArÇµunas in the

[600]

In the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am, the two brothers RÃ¢mas and Lakshmaá¹as
are compared to the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, to the sun and moon, as similar the one to
the other; and their reciprocal love reminds us of that of the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u.[601] RÃ¢mas and Lakshmaá¹as are always at
peace with each other; there is, however, a passage which may serve as a
link to connect the myth of the two friendly brothers and that of the
two hostile ones. When RÃ¢mas combats alone in the forest thousands of
monsters, Lakshmaá¹as stays with SÃ®tÃ¢, hidden in a cavern. [602] Once BÃ¢lin and SugrÃ®vas were
intimate friends, but, on account of a woman, they became mortal
enemies. SugrÃ®vas complains that BÃ¢lin, his elder brother, has deprived
him of his wife RumÃ¢;

[603] but it is not certain that
SugrÃ®vas did not rather steal BÃ¢lin's wife. BÃ¢lin seems especially to
represent the evening sun; the

[604] says of him that, while the sun is
not risen (

[605] fights in

the
shape of a demoniacal buffalo against BÃ¢lin, near the entrance of the
cave). The moon rises to show them the way. The monster escapes into the
cavern, upon which BÃ¢lin enters and follows him, whilst SugrÃ®vas remains
without, awaiting his return. After waiting a long time, SugrÃ®vas sees
blood flow out of the cave (in analogous legends, instead of blood, it
is a treasure, or else a princess or a beautiful maiden comes out in
shining garments). This is the blood of the monster, killed by BÃ¢lin;
but SugrÃ®vas believes it to be that of his brother BÃ¢lin. He returns
home, and showing his sorrow in public, declares that BÃ¢lin is dead, and
allows himself to be consecrated king in his stead (probably also
enjoying with the crown the wife of his brother). Meanwhile BÃ¢lin, after
having killed the monster MÃ¢yÃ¢vin, endeavours to come out of the cavern,
but he finds the entrance closed. Attributing at once this wicked action
to the brother SugrÃ®vas, he succeeds, after great efforts, in effecting
an opening; he comes out, returns to the palace, and expels SugrÃ®vas
from it, whom he persecutes ever after. [606] Even AÃ±gadas, BÃ¢lin's son,
irritated one day with SugrÃ®vas, accuses him of having once shut up his
brother BÃ¢lin in the cave, in order to possess himself of the latter's
wife. horse. [607] We have already noticed that the
Vedic and Slavonic hero begins his fortune with an ugly and bad horse;
the hero KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa, too, of the two brothers of the Zend myth, is the
good, the heroic, and truly glorious one. His brother, UrvÃ¢ksha,
according to a Parsee tradition,

[608] was banished to hell because he
had struck the fire which did not obey his commands (the evening sun
which descends into the infernal night); KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa avenges him. This is
evidently a Persian form of the myth of the Dioscuri, who, as it seems
to me, reappear once more in the two Zend brothers, GustÃ¢Ã§p and
AÃ§pÃ¢yaodha (he who fights with the horse). In the epic poem of Firdusi, the two brothers Piran and Pilsem, who
fight together against the Turanians, and of whom the former and elder
delivers the latter and younger from the dangers that he is exposed to
among the enemies, seem to me re-embodiments of the same myth. In
the story of Merhuma, who is stoned (the aurora lost in the mountain of
stone), in the

[609] we have the brother possessed by a
demon, who seduces the wife of his brother, who is travelling abroad. In
that of MansÃ»r, in the same

[610] the monstrous Fari assumes the
very shape of the absent husband, and succeeds in seducing his wife. In
another story in the

[611] two brothers, finding themselves
deceived in their expectations, set out together, each, for love of the
other, wandering about the world in search of a better fate. These are
three forms of the myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. With them is connected the story
of the maiden who comes out of the wood, of whom as many men, when she
appears, become enamoured. [612]

The fifth Calmuck story (of Hindoo origin) is unmistakably a
reproduction of the myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, even to the very mythical names
themselves. The king, Kun-snang (he who illumines all, like the Vedic
ViÃ§vavedas and the Slavonic Vsievedas, the all-seer), has by two
different mothers two sons–Sunlight (born in the year of the tiger;
perhaps in the sol-leo, in July, in summer, under the solar influence)
and Moonlight. The second wife does not love her step-son Sunlight, and
persecutes him, but the two brothers are devoted to each other, and when
Sunlight goes into exile (like RÃ¢mas), Moonlight follows him (as
Lakshmaá¹as follows RÃ¢mas, as the white lunar twilight follows the sun in
the forest of night). On the way, Moonlight is thirsty; Sunlight goes to
find water for him, but in the meantime Moonlight dies.[613] Sunlight returns, and is in
despair at the sight of his dead brother; however, a hermit has pity
upon him, and, having resuscitated Moonlight, adopts the two brothers as
his own sons. Near his abode there is a kingdom where the dragons keep
back the waters, unless they are given a young man born in the year of
the tiger. It oozes out that Sunlight is such a young man, and he is led
away to the king of that country. The daughter of the king falls in love
with him, and begs Sunlight not to be given to the dragons. The king is
furious against his daughter, and has her thrown with Sunlight into the
swamp where the dragons are.[614] The young couple break out into
such piteous lamentations, that the dragons are touched, and let
Sunlight and the young princess go free. When free, they find Moonlight,
who also becomes the husband of the beautiful princess, the two brothers
being inseparable, like the Vedic AÃ§vinÃ¢u. The three personages (white
twilight, or white moonlight, aurora, and sun) return together into the
kingdom of their birth, where, upon seeing them arrive, Sunlight's
step-mother (Night) dies of terror. Here the legend has all its mythical
splendour. In the sixteenth Mongol story, on the contrary, the friendship of the
two companions cannot last, because of the perfidy of one of them; while
they are travelling in the forest, the minister's son kills the king's
son. In the history of Ardshi-Bordshi, the two men born in
the palace are so like each other in everything, in shape, complexion,
dress, and horses, that they cannot be distinguished one from the other;
hence they dispute between themselves for the possession of everything,
of wife and sons. One is made like the other by witchcraft; he is the
son of a demon; and it is the marvellous king of the children who
discovers the secret.[615]

This exchange of husbands, or heroes, by means of demoniacal craft,
often occurs in European fairy-tales, like the exchange of wives. The
demon is now a water-carrier, now a washerman, now a woodcutter, now a
charcoal-burner, now a gipsy, now a Saracen, and now the devil in
propria persona. The Russian fairy-tales show us the two forms of the two brothers or
companions, i.e., the two that remain friends usque ad
mortem, and the friend betrayed by his perfidious companion. We find a zoological form of the legend of the two friends in one of
Afanassieff's stories. The horse delivers the child of one of his
masters from the bear, upon which his grateful masters feed him better,
whereas before they had almost let him die of starvation. The horse (the
sun) remembers in prosperity his companion in misfortune, the cat (the
moon), who is also allowed to starve, and gives it a part of what he
receives from his masters. The latter perceive this, and again ill-treat
the horse, who then forms the resolution of killing himself, in order
that the cat may eat him; but the cat refuses to eat his friend the
horse,[616] and is also determined to die. in

[617] one to be king and the other to
spit gold, flee from their perfidious mother (probably step-mother), who
persecutes them in their father's absence. They meet with a cowherd
taking his cows to the pasturage, and are hospitably entertained by him. Then, continuing their journey, they come to a place where two roads
meet, where, upon a pillar, this is written, "He who goes to the right
(to the east) will become a king; he who goes to the left (to the west,
into the kingdom of Kuveras, the western sun, the god of riches; when
the sun rises in the east the moon goes down in the west) will become
rich." One goes to the right; when it is morning, he rises, washes, and
dresses himself. He learns that the old king is dead (the old sun), and
that funeral honours are being paid to him in church. A decree says that
he whose candle lights of itself will be the new Tzar. [618] The Vedic god also has the
distinctive attribute of this wonderful candle, that of being lighted by
himself, of shining of himself,

sky,
towards the setting sun) his brother, who lives in great wealth. In his
rooms whole mountains of gold arise; when he spits, all is gold; there
is no place to put it,

[619] (the evening sky is one mass of
gold). The two brothers then set out together to find their poor old
father (the sun during the night). The younger brother goes to find for
himself a bride (probably the silvery moon), and the wicked mother (the
step-mother, night) is forsaken. Here, too, the legend is entirely of a
mythical character. In the two brothers we see now twilight and sun, now
the two twilights, now the spring and autumnal lights, now the sun and
the moon, but always the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, always two deities, two heavenly
beings closely connected with the phenomena of the lunar and solar
light. [620] The myth of the

AÃ§vinÃ¢u
cannot be solved by mathematical demonstrations, precisely on account of
the uncertainty presented by the crepuscular light which probably gave
rise to it. This continuous succession of shadows, penumbrÃ¦,
chiaroscuri, and shades of light, from the black darkness to the silver
moon, from the silver moon to the grey twilight of morning, which
gradually melts into, and confounds itself with the dawn, from the dawn
to the aurora, from the aurora to the sun; the same variations
recurring, but inversely, in the evening, from the dying sun to the
reddish and blood-coloured sky or evening aurora, from the evening
aurora to the grey twilight, from the grey twilight to the silver moon,
from the silver moon to the gloomy night,–this continual change of
colours, which meet, unite with, and pass into each other, originated
the idea of celestial companions, friends, or relations, who are now in
unison and now separate, who now approach to love each other, to move
together and affectionately follow each other, now rush upon each other
to fight, despoil, betray, and destroy each other turn by turn, who now
attract and are now attracted, are now seduced and now seducers, now
cheated and now deceivers, now victims, now sacrificers. Where
there

is a
family, there is love, hence come exemplary brothers, husbands, wives,
sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers, full of tenderness; that is the
obverse of the medal: where there are relations, there are disputes,
hence contentions between brothers, out of jealousy in love, or envy of
riches; perverse mothers-in-law, step-mothers, and sisters-in-law,
tyrannous fathers, perfidious wives; that is the reverse. This
contradiction of feelings is difficult to explain psychologically even
in man; how much more, therefore, is it so when it has to be analysed in
a mythical image, which assumes an animal form in one rapid flash of
imagination, and then disappears? On this account, in the case of some
myths, we must content ourselves with a general demonstration, at least
until new and positive data appear, on which it may be possible to base,
in a solid foundation, the real nature of the details of mythology. In
the absence of these data, we can only offer probabilities, and not
rules to the reader. As to the Vedic AÃ§vinÃ¢u, this much is certain: they
are found in unison with their wife, the aurora, after having passed
through the dangers of night, or after having enabled the heroes
protected by them–that is to say, their own heroic forms–to pass through
them; they are two splendid brother-horsemen; and they are especially
invoked in the first hours of morning. The myth in this Vedic form would
not appear to be of dubious interpretation. The white moon and the sun
take the aurora between them, that is, marry her; or else they present
her in marriage to Somas (with whom one of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the white light
or twilight, is in particular relation), in the quality of paranymphs. The aurora, in the morning, as well as in the evening, taken between the
sun and the moon, disappears. One would think that the twilight and the
sun present her together at

the
same time to the king or god Somas, or Lunus, for whom the daughter of
the sun has affection. One would also think that she was especially
united with the twilight, which is in especial relation with Somas,
observing how in the morning the aurora immediately succeeds the
twilight, and disappears when the sun shows himself, that is, rejoins
the twilight and forsakes the sun; and how in the evening, when the sun
hides himself, or when her husband is absent, she again unites herself
with the twilight, with whom she again flees and disappears, to reappear
once more with him in the morning. To continue; the absence of the sun
during the night tormented the popular phantasy in several ways. As much
as the aspect of the sky was negative with regard to the mythical
hero–that is to say, as much as the hero or god hides himself from the
view–just so much the more does popular imagination invest him with
positive qualities and exalt his greatness. The greatest of all deities
is that which is seen the least;–would that Roman Catholic priests
understood this mythological truth! Indras and Zeus are great when
within the thundering and lightning cloud. The sun becomes a hero when
he loses himself in the darkness of night and in the cloud. But it is
just at this very point that the demonstration of mythical particulars
becomes more difficult, because the myths are now founded, not merely
upon an external appearance or image, but often upon a simple subjective
hypothesis; and while the ancient image, possessing an objectivity
irrespective of the subject, can always be reconciled with the
observation of the new celestial phenomena which reproduce it, the
subjective hypothesis, being an individual phantasy, is lost. The
demonstration is therefore possible only in the essential parts. When
the sun was seen to disappear

in
the nocturnal sky, this sky appeared in the various aspects of an ocean,
a mountain, a forest, a cavern, or a voracious monster which devoured
the hero. But has the sun lost himself by accident, or has he been
precipitated into the night by the aurora and her crepuscular lover,
perfidiously united together, in order that they may have more freedom
in their loves? This is a dilemma of which the two solutions originate a
double series of legends,–the brother betrayed by the brother, and the
hero who goes to succour his unfortunate brother fallen into the power
of the monsters. The hour of day which the French indicate by the
expressive phrase

killing the monster. The action of the principal hero is well defined,
and therefore evident; and the reference is equally clear when the
aurora is represented as experiencing the same fate as the sun, her
husband or brother. They descend together into the night, which makes
them invisible, and together emerge from it happily. The myth becomes richer when the aurora throws herself into the arms
of a rival of her husband, because the character of this rival is
various. Now he is a handsome youth who resembles the legitimate
husband, either as the twilight or as Lunus; now he is a real demoniacal
monster, the demon himself, the black night. In proportion to the
variety of aspects and relations which the hero's rival assumes, does
the myth become more complicated, and its interpretation more difficult;
hence the story-tellers are often in the habit of interrupting their
narrative by saying, "Now, let us leave this or that hero, and return to
such or such another." These interruptions of the stories have their
mythological reason. We can understand, for instance, how the aurora, or
daughter of the sun, should be conceived of as, in a moment of feminine
weakness, falling in love with the moon, which she sees on the other
side of the heavens, and desirous of being conducted to him as his
bride. We can understand how Lunus, reciprocating the love-glance of the
aurora at the other extremity of the sky, should appear to be drawing
her to himself, and wishing to seduce her. We can also understand how
now the moon, now the sun, appears to seduce the aurora and carry her
off from her legitimate husband. In these cases the infidelity of the
hero or the heroine is evident; but woe to him who attempts to carry the
demonstration or the proof of this interpretation too far, for when the
seducer and seduced, be the seducer male or female, are
thought of as enjoying together the fruits of their perfidy, the myth
must come to an end, as no one can conceive the possibility of the moon
and the aurora living or doing anything together; no one can tell what
the aurora and the twilight, phenomena appertaining exclusively to the
morning and evening, and which only appear when the sun rises from the
mountain, do together in the night. The phenomenon ceases, the mythical
personages vanish too, and the story-teller breaks off his narrative,
because he possesses no data upon which to continue it. And so with all
the myths; they can only be explained on the condition that we do not
insist upon explaining too much. We must therefore be contented to see
the girl aurora carried off in the evening and the hero sun recover her
in the morning, or to conceive of the aurora and the sun fleeing away
together into the night, but we must not be too inquisitive as to the
manner in which they do so. The moon, or good fairy, sometimes teaches
them the way; but their nocturnal actions are but little seen into;
those which are spoken of as performed by them at night refer either to
the moment in which night begins, or to that in which it comes to an
end. During the night they wander about until they see a light (the
guiding moon or delivering light of day); they remain in the chest or
cask thrown into the water until it is carried to the other shore beyond
the sea, or on the eastern coast. In their nocturnal journey the moon
plays the part now of the good old man, or the good fairy; now of the
good cow, or the bull; now of the grey horse, the steed of night, who,
in three stations, bears them to their goal; now of the bird who,
nourished upon their flesh, carries them to their destination; and now
we have, on the contrary, the monster itself, or the step-mother who
threatens, tortures, and persecutes them. The hero shows his
greatest strength when hidden, but it is used now to send out the cows,
now to recover the ravished bride, now to unchain the rivers kept back
by the dragons, now to make the water of health gush forth, and now to
destroy the monster and deliver himself. The hero displays his greatest
powers when contending with the monster; but it is in order to his own
deliverance. In the earliest epochs of the legend he is foolish, ill,
drunken, unhappy, and stony; one can only speak of him by what is seen
of him externally. The cloud-barrel moves; it is the barrel full of
water which moves of its own accord in order to please the hero: the
cloud-barrel drops rain upon the earth; it is the foolish one who lets
the wine run out of the cask: the cloud-forest moves; it is the trunk of
a tree which attaches itself to the horse ridden by the hero, and
massacres his enemies–i.e., the cloud or darkness disappears,
and the hero comes out victorious. The part performed by the solar hero
in the night or in the cloud seems to me, therefore, almost always of a
nearly certain interpretation, but only so long as he is alone, or with
but one companion; when the one hero is transformed into three, or five,
or six, who accompany each other, or when he meets other mythical
personages of a nature akin to his own, and when he speaks and acts in
unison with them, the legend confuses the myth, in order to explain
which, we are often obliged to stretch the sense of the adverb
together to the signification, now of a whole night, and now of
an entire year. When we find, for instance, in tradition, the twelve
months of the year associated with twelve old men round the fire, we
know that the fire is the sun, round which the twelve months turn in the
sky in the space of a year. Here together is amplified to
denote, therefore, the period of a year and the entire width of the
sky. I have been led into this long, but, I trust, not idle digression, in
order to explain the Russian story of the two brothers, of whom it is
said that they go together, one to the right and the other to the left. In whatever way the AÃ§vinÃ¢u are to be understood, whether as twilight
and sun, as spring and autumn, or as sun and moon, it is impossible to
comprehend how they can travel in the same direction; the ways they take
must therefore be separate. The sun and the evening twilight do not
advance in opposite directions; the morning sun and that of evening
occupy opposite positions, but not at the same time; the sun and moon
advance at the same time in the sky, but not conjointly and upon the
same path, like two travelling companions. It is therefore necessary to
suppose that the journey of the two brothers either happens at different
periods, although it may be in the same night or the same day, or else
takes its start from different places, although always in the sky; in
the evening the moon is seen advancing from east to west, whilst the
hidden sun travels from west to east; when the sun has arrived in the
east, the moon goes down in the west. The eastern sun is bent, in the
daytime, upon following and finding his brother who has gone to the
west; and when he arrives there he sees, besides his brother, his
brother's immense treasures also. With this is connected the other
version of the myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the poor brother and the rich one. This is probably the weary, thirsty, and hungry sun, who, having during
the day given all his wealth away, demands hospitality from, and offers
his services to, his rich brother; the latter drives him away, and the
poor brother wanders alone, poorer and sadder than before, into the
forest, where he makes his fortune by digging up a treasure which
enriches him, whilst his rich brother in
the west becomes poor. The story of the treasure, in connection with the
two brothers and the skilful thief, was familiar to the Greeks in the
vicissitudes of AgamÃªdÃªs and Trophonios (in Pausanias[621]), who stole King HÃ¼rieus's
treasure, on which account one of the two brothers was to lose his
head. [622]

There
were once two brothers, named respectively Cienzo and Meo (Vincenzo and
Meo). When they were born two enchanted horses and two enchanted dogs
also came into the world. Cienzo goes about the world in search of
fortune; he comes to a place where there is a dragon with seven heads,
from whom a beautiful princess must be delivered. As long as he does not
cut all the heads off, the dragon goes and rubs itself against a herb
which possesses the virtue of fastening on to the body again the head
which had been cut off. Cienzo cuts off all the dragon's heads, "pe
gratia de lo sole Lione" (by the grace of the Lion sun,

and
when BrÃ¼nhilt throws herself upon the funeral pyre, she also places a
sword between herself and Sigurd's corpse. [623] In the royal or heroic weddings by
proxy of the Middle Ages a similar custom was observed. In the popular
Piedmontese, Bergamasc, and Venetian song

[624] of the pilgrim who comes from
Rome, the pilgrim is separated from the woman only by a wisp of straw. Towards morning Meo also sees the beautiful fairy in the house over the
way; he guesses that Cienzo has been drawn into her snare, and goes to
deliver him. He makes his enchanted dog devour her, and frees his
brother, awakening him out of his sleep. Cienzo learning that Meo had
slept with his wife, cuts off his head; but when he learns from his wife
how Meo had divided the sheets when he lay beside her, he bewails his
rashness, has recourse to the herb with which the dragon rubbed itself
when one of its heads had been cut off, and by this means fastens Meo's
head on to his body again. The principal auxiliary, however, to one in particular of the two
brothers, as of the third in the legend of the three brothers, is his
horse. When the hero devotes himself to the trade of thieving, his most
glorious achievement is robbing the king's horse. When the young hero has been educated by the devil, it is in the
shape of a horse that he succeeds in escaping from him. When the solar hero fights, his greatest strength is in his horse. When
the hero dies, his horse, too, is sacrificed. Let us now illustrate, by some examples, these four circumstances
relative to the myth of the horse. In the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam,[625] the god Indras appears in the form
now of a horseman, now of a horse. It is, moreover, upon such a heroic
horse that the young UtaÃ±kas flees from the king of the serpents, after
having recovered from him the queen's earrings, which the king of the
serpents had stolen. In this legend reference is made to several myths;
to that of the hero in the infernal regions, to that of the hero-thief,
and to the legend of the horse which saves the fugitive hero, the same
as the hero who leads away the horse. [626] we have Kapilas, a form of
Vishá¹us, or of the solar hero (inasmuch as he is of a reddish colour, or
else of the evening sun), who carries off the horse destined for the
aÃ§vamedhas, that is to be sacrificed. (In other words, the solar horse,
the horse which was meant for the sacrifice, escapes from it, in the
same way as, in the preceding chapter, we have seen the bull escape into
the forests.) In the

[627] the horse destined for the
sacrifice is, on the contrary, carried off by a serpent (

ashes. Their nephew, Aá¹sumant (he who is furnished with rays, the radiant sun
of morning), on the contrary, delivers the horse out of the forest. In
the evening he is reconducted back to the place of sacrifice, on the
golden pavement, after having made the journey round the world. [628] In the same way as we have seen,
in the preceding chapter, that the bull or the cow is touched or struck
as an augury of fruitfulness and abundance, in the

[629] KÃ¢uÃ§alyÃ¢ touches the horse (a
stallion) in order to be fruitful, as he desires to have sons
(

[630] Of course we must always refer the
legend to the myth of the solar horse, which, even when sacrificed,
makes itself fruitful, so that it may rise again in the morning in a new
and young form. And we can easily prove that the horse of the aÃ§vamedhas
was a mythical horse, since the aÃ§vamedhas was originally a celestial
ceremony, seeing we read in the

[631] We saw a short time ago

how
in the

[632] a word which means the ravisher,
as well as the vulture (as a bird of prey). The thief plays a principal
part, even in the Vedic myths. In the war between the demons and the
gods, described at length in the first book of the

[633]], shows us how already in the myth
the legend of the theft of the earrings (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u), or of the queen's
gem (the sun), or of the treasure, must be united with the theft of the
horse (the sun itself), as it seems to be united in the legend of
UtaÃ±kas, before quoted, in which UtaÃ±kas flees upon the divine horse as
he carries away from hell the earrings of the queen, which another
skilful thief, the king of the serpents, had, in his turn, stolen from
him. (Herodotos already knew the story of the skilful thief who robs the
king's treasure and obtains

the
king's daughter to wife; he applies it to the king of Egypt,
Rampsinitos.)

[634] Here, therefore, we have the
swift-footed animal, whose mane and horns are entangled to the trees. Another Vedic hymn presents to us the hero Tugras lost in the sea, who
embraces a tree, and is saved by means of it. [635] In popular stories, the hero is
often saved upon a tree, either because the thieves or the bear cannot
see him, or because he is thus able to see the horizon; the tree brings
good luck to him, now because by letting something drop or making a
noise, he terrifies the thieves, now because he cheats the cowherds,
whose cattle he wishes to possess himself of, by appearing now

upon
one tree, and now upon another; whereupon the cowherds begin to dispute
about his identity, one affirming that it is the same person, another
that it cannot be; they therefore hastily go back to inspect the first
tree, and leave the cattle unguarded, upon which the hero-thief descends
from the tree, and drives them away before him (this occurs in

[636] which narrates the adventures of
Little Thomas Berennikoff, blind of an eye, the

in
order to leap from it upon the horse's back. The horse feels the man on
his back, and plunges so much that he roots up the whole tree, and drags
it after him, carrying Tom away into the heart of the Chinese army. The
Chinese are struck down by the oak-tree and trodden under foot by the
furious charger, and those who are not killed are put to flight. (The
mythical wooden horse which proved so fatal to the Trojans appears to be
a mythical variety of this horse with the tree so fatal to the Chinese.)
The Emperor of China declares that he will never make war again with a
hero of Little Tom's strength. Then the King of Prussia, an enemy of the
Chinese, gives, in gratitude to Tom, and as a reward for his valour, his
own daughter to wife. It is remarkable that, in the course of the story,
Alexin once observes to Elias that the horse which Little Tom had
brought from his house showed none of the characteristic qualities of a
hero's horse. Alexin, as the priest's son, is the wise hero; Elias, the
strong one, who had conceived a high opinion of his new colleague,
Little Tom, seriously answers that a hero's strength consists in
himself, and not in his horse. However, the development of the story
shows that Alexin was right; without the fiery horse of the dead hero,
Tom would not have dispersed the Chinese. [637] we read that Indras, when he
removes himself from his two horses, becomes like to a weak and wearied
mortal; when he yokes them, he becomes strong. The enemies in the
battles cannot resist the charge of the two fair-coloured horses of the
god Indras;

[638] and not only this, but one part
alone of the

divine
horse is sometimes sufficient to give assurance of victory to the
hero-god. Another hymn

[639] sings, "A horse's tail wert thou
then, O Indras;" that is, when Indras vanquished the monster serpent. It
is with the head of the horse DadhyaÅÄ that Indras discomfits his
enemies. [640] The horse of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, which
kills the monster serpent, has already been referred to in these pages. The solar horse DadhikrÃ¢, the same as DadhyaÅÄ, in another hymn of the

[641] is celebrated as a swift falcon,
luminous, impetuous, who destroys his enemies like a hero-prince, who
runs like the wind. His enemies tremble, terrified by him, as by the
thundering sky; he fights against a thousand enemies–invincible,
formidable, and resplendent. Finally, the horses of the god Agnis are
said to vanquish the enemies with their fore-feet. [642]

When AÃ±gadas wishes to fight with the monster NarÃ¢ntakas, in the
RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am,[643] he strikes with his fist the head
of his great and swift-footed horse, and then with another blow he
smites the monster in the chest, and kills him. In the seven adventures of Rustem, related by Firdusi, the
hero's horse fights against the monster, and drives him away, while the
hero sleeps. It is said of Bucephalus, the horse which Alexander the Great alone
was able to tame–so called because he had, it would seem, on his head
protuberances similar to the horns of a bull (we saw not long since how
the mane of the solar horse is spoken of as horns in the Vedic
hymns)–that he several times saved Alexander in battle, and that, though
mortally wounded, in an engagement in India, in the flank and head, he
still summoned up strength enough to flee away with extraordinary
swiftness and save his master, and then died. Pliny, quoting Philarcus,
says that when Antiochus was slain, the warrior who had killed him
endeavoured to ride his horse, but that the latter threw him on the
ground, and he expired. Of PÃªgasos, the winged horse which bore the hero Bellerophon over the
waters, and by means of whom that hero won his glorious victories, we
know that the warrior-goddess Pallas wore the effigy upon her
helmet. Suetonius writes of the horse of Julius CÃ¦sar that it had almost
human feet, with toes ("pedibus prope humanis, et in modum digitorum
ungulis fissis"), from which the aruspices prognosticated to CÃ¦sar the
empire of the world; this horse, like Bucephalus, and every heroic
courser, would bear no other rider than its master–the great
conqueror. The horse Baiardo, in Ariosto, fights the enemies with its
feet. The hippogriff of Ariosto has, moreover, the privilege of being
winged like PÃªgasos, and of walking on air, like the Tatos of the
Hungarians. The name of Falke, given to the horse of the Germanic and
Scandinavian hero Dietrich or Thidrek (Theodoricus), induces us to
believe that it too had the same winged nature. In the Edda, Skirner receives from Frey a horse which
carried its rider through fogs (waters) and flames, and the sword which
strikes of itself when the wearer of it happens to be a hero. The horse
of Sigurd or SÃ®frit exhibits the same bravery in bearing the hero intact
through the flames. This happens in the morning, when the sun emerges
safe and sound from the flames of the aurora; in the evening, on the
contrary, when the sun loses itself in the flames of the aurora, or when
the solar hero dies, his horse, too, like the horse of Balder in the
Edda, is burned upon the pyre or sacrificed; the resurrection
of the dead horse and that of the dead hero happen at the same time. The
horse's head which protrudes out of the window, represented in ancient
Hellenic tombs, and preserved in Germanic customs,[644] is, for man, a symbol of
resurrection. The head of Vishá¹us, that of UÄÄÃ¢iá¸¥Ã§ravas, and that of
DadhyaÅÄ, in Hindoo tradition, have the same meaning. He who enters into
this head finds death and hell; he who comes out of it rises again to
new life. The pious Christian belief in the resurrection that is to
come, and the numerous mediÃ¦val legends of Europe concerning dead heroes
or maidens who are resuscitated, had their origin and ground in the
contemplation of the annual and daily resurrection of the sun. In
other Russian stories, the horse of the hero, Ivan TzareviÄ, is at first
bound underground by twelve iron chains; when Ivan rides him, he breaks
them all. [645] The horse which Ivan the thief is
told to carry off from his master

[646] is shut up within three gates made
fast by six bolts; if he steals it, he is to receive a reward of 200
roubles; and if he does not, 200 bastinadoes will be his punishment. Ivan takes his master's clothes, disguises himself as a gentleman, and,
imitating his voice, orders the grooms to bring him his favourite horse. The grooms are deceived, and obey, and thus Ivan carries the horse off. Finally, in a third Russian story,

[647] Ivan TzareviÄ must ride a hero's
horse on the occasion of his nuptials with the beautiful but wicked
Anna. He has recourse to his preceptor Katoma, surnamed Hat of Oak (here
we find again the hero in relation with the tree and the horse), who
orders the blacksmith to prepare a hero's horse; twelve young
blacksmiths (the twelve hours of the night, or else the twelve months of
the year) draw twelve bolts, open twelve doors, and lead out an
enchanted horse, bound with twelve iron chains. Scarcely has the
preceptor mounted on its back when it flies higher than the forest which
stays still, and lower than the cloud which moves. [648] The preceptor subdues it by taking
hold of its mane with one hand, and striking it with the other between
the ears with four pieces, one after another, of an enchanted iron
pillar. The horse then begs, with a man's voice, for its life, the power
of speech being a distinctive attribute of the hero's horse (a power of
which it often makes use, as Rustem's horse does, for instance, to warn
the hero of the dangers which surround him, and to give him good

advice;
sometimes, on the contrary, when it is in the monster's power, it plays
the part of a spy upon the hero's actions, and reports them to the
monster);

[649] it promises also to do the will of
the preceptor. Katoma, calling the horse dog's flesh, orders it to stay
still the next day, which is the day fixed for the wedding, and, when
the bridegroom Ivan is to ride it, to seem as though it were oppressed
by a great weight. In the seventh Esthonian story, the young hero steals the horse from
the master (the devil, or the black monster of night) in whose service
he had engaged himself. When he comes to the place where the sun sets,
he bethinks himself of binding the horse with iron chains (the rope of
Yamas, or Varuá¹as, the nocturnal coverer or binder, which binds the
Vedic hero Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, the sun, he of the golden rod), in order that it
may not escape and go back again. This particular is very interesting,
as rendering the meaning of the myth more manifest. Seeing that the sun,
in the evening, does not return, it was supposed that the solar horse
had been bound by the hero himself, who had stolen it. In the European popular tales we sometimes have, instead of the hero
who carries off his master's horse, the hero himself, who escapes from
his master in the form of a horse, helped in his flight by the daughter
of his master, by the magician's or demon's daughter or black
maiden (who
afterwards becomes beautiful and luminous). In the Hungarian belief, the
youngest of the witch's daughters (the aurora) often assumes the form of
the heroic horse of the Tatos. She becomes Tatos when the hero, meeting
her, strikes her on the forehead with the bridle; then she carries him,
in the shape of a horse, into the air. In the Russian story,[650] the son of a merchant goes to be
instructed by a wise magician, who teaches him every kind of knowledge,
and, among the rest, what sheep say when they bleat, birds when they
sing, and horses when they neigh. At last the young man, having learned
every species of mischief, returns home and transforms himself into a
horse, in order that his father may sell him at the market and make
money; but he warns his father not to give up the bridle, that he may
not fall again into the hands of the magician. The father forgets, and
sells horse and bridle together. The magician attaches the horse by a
ring to an oak-tree; the black maiden (dievki Äernavke), the sister of
the devil, gives the horse millet and hydromel; the horse thus gains
strength enough to break the chain which binds him to the tree, and
escapes. The devil follows him; the horse becomes a fish, and from a
fish a ring; the king's daughter buys the ring and puts it on her
finger; during the day it is a ring (the solar disc), and during the
night a handsome youth, who lies in the bed of the queen's daughter (the
hidden sun, or the moon, in the darkness of night). One day the princess
lets the ring fall on the ground, and it breaks into a thousand pieces
(the evening sun which falls upon the mountain); then the devil becomes
a cock, to pick up the pieces of the broken ring; but a little piece
falls
under the princess's foot; this piece is transformed into a falcon,
which strangles and devours the cock. [651] we have SÃ»ryas, the sun, as
SÃ¢uvaÃ§vyas, or son of SvaÃ§vyas, that is, of him who has fine horses; but
as, besides SvaÃ§vyas, we find SvaÃ§vas, he who has a fine horse, the sun
itself would seem to be this horse. The legend narrates that SvaÃ§vas,
having no children, requested the sun to give him some, and that the
sun, to please him, was himself born of him. SvaÃ§vas, he who has a fine
horse and has no sons, is perhaps the same as the old man who has lost
his son by selling the horse; when the sun returns his son also comes
back again. In the Vedic expressions,

[652]), the hero would seem to be
indicated who has not as yet that horse or that bridle, without which he
is powerless; for the idea of the hero is rarely unaccompanied by that
of the horseman. For the horseman hero his horse is his all, and sometimes it even
takes the bit in its mouth, then the hero punishes it. We have already
noticed the well-known Hellenic myth of PhaethÃ´n, who is, with both the
chariot and the horses, precipitated into the waters, because the horses
threatened to set the earth on fire. This happens every day towards
evening, when the sun sets; the whole sky goes down, then the sun is
thrown down into the ocean of night; the course of the solar steeds is
interrupted, and the wheels of the chariot no longer turn. A similar
catastrophe is repeated on St John's Day, at the summer
solstice, in which the sun stops and begins to retire, for which reason
the light of day, from this time to Christmas, grows less and less. [653] for hunters to fire at the sun,
believing that they will thereby become infallible hunters. According to
another popular German belief, he who, on St John's Day, fires towards
the sun is condemned ever after to hunt for ever, like Odin, the eternal
hunter; and both superstitions have their reason. In the night, as well
as in the period during which the splendour of the sun diminishes, and
especially in autumn, the gloomy forest of heaven is filled with every
kind of ferocious animal; the sun enters this forest, becomes moon, and
hunts the wild beasts in it during the whole of the night, or of the
year that is, until he is born again. In the

[654] Indras, to please his favourite,
EtaÃ§as, after having drunk the ambrosia, pushes the clouds that had
fallen behind before the flying steeds of the sun,

[655] that is to say, he prevents the
solar hero, drawn by horses, either by the cloud in a tempest, or by the
darkness of night, from going on; and he even strikes the wheels
themselves of the solar chariot to arrest its incendiary course. From
these Vedic data it is easy to pass to the Hellenic PhaethÃ´n, who is
precipitated into the waters on account of the horses. The hero killed
on account of his horses is a frequent subject of mythology, and the
Greek name Hippolytos refers to this

kind
of death. Hippolytos, the son of Theseus, fleeing from his father, who
supposes him guilty of incest with his step-mother Phedra, is thrown
from the chariot broken to pieces, when the horses that draw it approach
the sea and are terrified by marine monsters. This is a variation of the
legend of the young hero, persecuted by his step-mother, who is thrown
into the sea, with the novel and remarkable accompaniment that it is his
horses themselves which are the cause of his death. The Christian legend
of St Hippolytos has appropriated this particular trait, representing
the holy martyr, who was prefect under the emperors Decius and Valerian,
as dying, having been condemned to be torn in pieces by horses. The poet
Prudentius comments upon the story in these two curious distichs, on the
occasion of the Roman judge pronouncing capital punishment against St
Hippolytos–

"Ille supinata residens cervice, quis inquit

Dicitur? affirmant dicier Hippolytum. Ergo sit Hippolytus; quatiat turbetque
jugales

Intereatque feris dilaceratus equis."

But the horses which draw the hero into the water are the same as
those that save him by carrying him over the deep, drawing the chariot
or ship on the sea towards the shore. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u do the same in the
á¹igvedas, where they save from the waves both themselves and
other heroes upon their chariot, which is compared to a ship.[656] Hero and horse always have the
same fate. In
the

[657] on the arrival of the god Indras,
the horse neighs, the cow lows, like a messenger between heaven and
earth. The neighing of this horse, and the lowing of this cow, are the
thundering of the sun in the cloud. By this neighing or lowing, man is
informed that the hero-god Indras is beginning his battles in heaven. Another hymn, which calls the two horses of Indras two rays of the sun
(sÃ»ryasya ketÃ»), celebrates them as neighing and pouring out
ambrosia,

[658]

[659] Neighing is the laughter of the
horse. We have seen, in the preceding chapter, how the bull speaks and
the fish laughs at sight of coition; and so we have here, in the story
of Darius, the horse who neighs on account of the mare.–To return to the
horse of mythology; the solar horse neighs

within
the thundering-cloud which, as a cow, the bull makes pregnant, and as a
mare, the stallion, and neighs at the approach of the aurora, who
appears now as the driver of a hundred chariots

[660] (a round number, like the hundred
thousand horses which, in another hymn,

[661] the god Indras drives; a favourite
number, like seven, which is applied to the same solar horses, solar
rays and AÃ±girasas

[662])–on which account it can be
compared with the Hellenic AphroditÃª Hippodameia–now even as a real
mare. The sun is now a driver of horses, and now himself a horse; in the
same way, the aurora is now an Amazon horsewoman, now a driver of
chariots, now aÃ§vÃ¢vatÃ®, and now a mare. When the sun approaches the
aurora, or when the horse approaches the mare, the horse neighs. We know
how the AÃ§vinÃ¢u considered themselves sons of the wife of the sun,
Saraá¹yÃ», daughter of Tvashá¹­ar, who united herself to the sun in the form
of a mare. Whether this Saraá¹yÃ» be the cloud or the aurora, we have in
her, anyhow, a mare with which the sun, solar hero, or solar horse,
unites himself to produce the twin heroes, who are, for this reason,
also called the two sons of the mare. [663] We have already seen, in the
preceding chapter, a hero and a heroine who are hatched from eggs; of
the Dioscuri, we know that they were born of the egg of Leda; and the
mare's egg is the subject of a story in the

[664] Greek writers have handed down
several

cases
of coition between men and mares, and between horses and women, with
corresponding births of monstrous conformation. Now, unnatural as such
births must appear to us, they are, in mythology, in strict accordance
with nature. In the preceding chapter we saw the cow which leaps over
the hare, and explained this phenomenon by the cloud or darkness
covering the moon, and also by the earth covering the moon in eclipses. In Herodotus and Valerius Maximus, a mare, in the time of Xerxes, gives
birth to a hare; and we must here understand the hare to be the moon,
coming out of the darkness or clouds; and when we read that the hare
suffocated the mare, we must understand it to mean the moon as
dispersing the darkness or clouds (perhaps also the sun or evening
aurora). We must have recourse in this way to the myth to comprehend the
examples of parturition without coition found in some Hindoo legends,
and applied to heroes, as well as the curious discussions and
information which we find in the ancients, from Aristotle, Varro, Pliny,
Columella, Solinus, and St Augustin, to Albertus Magnus and Aldrovandi,
concerning mares, and especially Spanish and Portuguese mares, made
pregnant by the wind (called by Oppianos

[665] of the windy feet), and which are
also spoken of in the

[666] with less

decency,
in reference to the myth of the maiden born of the tree. The horse of Ariosto, too, has a similar nature–

"Questo Ã¨ il destrier che fu dell' Argalia

Che di fiamma e di vento era concetto

E senza fieno e biada si nutria

De l'aria pura e Rabican fu detto."

The horse of Ciolle, in a Tuscan proverb, also feeds upon wind
alone. The horse of Dardanos, son of Zeus, was also said to be born of the
wind, which brings us back to the Vedic Marutas, whose chariots have
horses for wings, and to the volucer currus of the Diespiter of
Horace.[667] In the Sanská¹it tongue, the
expression vÃ¢tÃ¢Ã§vas, or wind-horse, is very common, to indicate
a very swift-footed horse. No sooner is the horse UÄÄÃ¢iá¸¥Ã§ravas born than he neighs; and like
him, in the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, the hero AÃ§vatthÃ¢man laughs, the son
of Droá¹as, properly he who has strength in his horse, which is the same
as the hero-horse. Moreover, as the horse exults by neighing over the good fortune of
the hero who rides him, so he not only becomes sad, but sheds real tears
when his rider is about to meet with misfortune. coursers shed tears,

[668] as a sinister omen, RÃ¢vanas is the
monster of darkness and clouds; when the cloud begins to disperse, drops
of rain fall, that is, the horses of the monster weep. The treacherous
sister who is confederate with the monster against her brother, in
Russian stories, is condemned by her brother, who kills the monster, to
fill a whole basin with her tears. [669] These tears are also a legendary
symbol of the rain which falls when the solar hero has torn the cloud in
two. [670] Note that this legend of the
horses that weep is connected with the passage of water, of the Rubicon
(a river which no geographer has been able to identify with certainty,
probably because the legend of CÃ¦sar relating to it is a fable of
mythical origin. We know how mythical beliefs incline to assume a human
form, and are especially prone to group themselves round the great
personages of history–Cyrus, Alexander, Romulus, CÃ¦sar, Augustus,
Vespasian, Attila, Theodoric, and Charlemagne are proofs of this; and
perhaps a day will come in which Napoleon I. or Garibaldi will offer a
new

the dust; in the

[672] the horses of Achilleus weep
bitterly for the death of their hero. This is a variety of the legend of
the horses which throw the solar hero down into the waters, the ocean of
night or the clouds, and of that of the horses of PoseidÃ´n. The mists
which after sunset in the evening impregnate the air, and the diurnal or
nocturnal rains, as well as the autumnal ones, cause tears to fall upon
the ground, or weep over the (apparent) death of the solar hero. The dew of the morning, on the contrary, which comes from the mouth
of the solar horse like foam, or from its hoof as ambrosia and salutary
water, is fraught with every species of healthful influence. [673] and upon the letter

[674] We have seen already that

the
horse of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u is the killer of the monster serpent, and that the
horse's head DadhyaÅÄ, he who goes in the milk or in the liquefied
butter, and who is found in a sea of milk, discomfits the enemies of
Indras. A Vedic hymn sings that, with the foam of the waters, Indras
beats down the head of the monster serpent. [675] In Tuscany, the whooping-cough is
called the horse-cough or asinine-cough,

[676] and it is thought that the cough
is cured by giving the children to drink the foam from the horse's
mouth, or causing them to drink in the water where a horse has been
drinking. This is a remedy founded upon the principle

[677] also recommend the saliva of a
horse as a cure for cough, particularly in the case of consumptive
patients, adding that the sick person is cured in three days, but that
the horse dies; a superstition which must have had its origin in the
mythical horse who feeds on ambrosia, and who loses his strength, and
expires when his saliva, foam, ambrosia, or dew is taken from him. It is
well known that the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, besides being luminous horsemen, were, as
friends of men, also exceedingly skilful physicians; nor could they be
otherwise, having in their power the head of DadhyaÅÄ which is in

the
ambrosia, that is, whose foam is ambrosia. The Dioscuri also frequently
appear, in European legends, as unexpected and miraculous deliverers. With this mythical belief of the horse that produces ambrosia, is also
connected the transformation, described by Ovid in the second book of
the

But the solar horse does not produce ambrosia with his mouth
alone. [678]), and makes use of them in the
myth, and in the legend, not only to combat the enemies, but also to
break open the earth, and cause ambrosial fountains to spring out of it. Sometimes ambrosia pours out of the hoof of the horse itself. In the

[679] the horses of Agnis are said to
have hands (

[680] It is not necessary for me to
instance here the famous fountain of the horse, or

HippokrÃªnÃª,
which Bellerophon's horse PÃªgasos caused to spring out of the earth by
breaking the soil with his hoof (called also for this reason

[681] In a Russian story,

[682] when Johnny (Ivanushka) sees a
horse's hoof, he is sorely tempted to drink out of it, but is dissuaded
by his sister. He experiences the same temptation upon seeing a bull's
hoof, and afterwards that of a kid. At last he gives way, drinks from
the kid's hoof, and is himself transformed into a kid. In the footprint
of a horse's hoof, in other stories, the ant is in danger of being
drowned; saved by a man, it is ever afterwards grateful to him. [683]

Several myths which we have already noticed in the preceding chapter
as applied to the bull, occur again in connection with the horse; as,
for instance, the birds which come out of the horse; the hero who takes
the horse's skin off, seizing it by the tail in order to make a sack of
it; the swift horse of Adrastus, which runs after the tortoise (a Greek
proverb);[684] the lunar horse, and the
solar one. These exchanges between moon and sun, and between bull and
horse, are happily indicated by the Latin poet, Fulgentius:–

"Jam PhÅ“bus disjungit equos, jam Cynthia jungit,

Quasque soror liquit, frater pede temperat
undas:

Tum nox stellato cÅ“lum circumlita peplo

CÅ“rula rorigenis pigrescere jusserat alis

Astrigeroque nitens diademate luna
bicornis

Bullarum bijugis conscenderat Ã¦quora
tauris."

Laver, who take the horse, as well as the mule and the ass, under their
especial protection, not to speak of the glorious horsemen St George, St
Michael, St James, St Maurice, St Stephen, St Vladimir, and St Martin,
especially revered by warriors, and in whose honour the principal orders
of knighthood in Europe were founded. But religions being, from one
point of view, the caricature of mythologies, there is now some
difference between the mythical old deities and the legendary new ones,
inasmuch as the former would at times ingenuously accept the homage of
the animal in effigy, as we have observed in the preceding chapter;
while the latter, and they who purvey to them upon earth, not being
quite so simple, never leave their devotee in peace until they have
received, at sight and without discount, the full value of their
favours. In the Life of San Gallo, we read that, in the times of King
Pepin (we already know what these times mean), a certain Willimar, being
ill, promised, if cured, to offer a horse to the Church of San Gallo. Having recovered his health, he forgot his promise; but passing one day
before the church of the saint, his horse stopped before the gate, and
by no possibility could it be induced to-move on, until Willimar had at
last declared his intention of fulfilling his vow. In the Life of St
Martin, there is a rather gayer variation of the same anecdote. King
Clodoveus, after having become a Christian, when fighting against the
Visigoths, promises his own horse to St Martin, if he grants the victory
to him. Having obtained it, Clodoveus regrets being obliged to deprive
himself of his good charger, and beseeches St Martin to be kind enough
to take money instead, offering him a hundred pieces of gold. St Martin
thinks the sum insufficient, and asks for double, which Clodoveus gives;
but, inasmuch as a little heretic blood

still runs in his veins, he cannot refrain from aiming a pointed
witticism at him: "Martinus, quantum video, auxiliator est facilis, sed
mercator difficilis!"
