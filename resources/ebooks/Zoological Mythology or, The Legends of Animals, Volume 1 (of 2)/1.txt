I. THE COW
AND THE BULL. Section I.–The Cow and the Bull in the Vedic
Hymns. SUMMARY. Prelude.–The vault of Heaven as a luminous cow.–The gods and
goddesses, sons and daughters of this cow.–The vault of Heaven as a
spotted cow.–The sons and daughters of this cow, i.e. the
winds, Marutas, and the clouds, Pá¹iÃ§nayas.–The wind-bulls subdue the
cloud-cows.–Indras, the rain-sending, thundering, lightening, radiant
sun, who makes the rain fall and the light return, called the bull of
bulls.–The bull Indras drinks the water of strength.–Hunger and thirst
of the heroes of mythology.–The cloud-barrel.–The horns of the bull and
of the cow are sharpened.–The thunderbolt-horns.–The cloud as a cow, and
even as a stable or hiding-place for cows.–Cavern where the cows are
shut up, of which cavern the bull Indras and the bulls Marutas remove
the stone, and force the entrance, to reconquer the cows, delivering
them from the monster; the male Indras finds himself again with his
wife.–The cloud-fortress, which Indras destroys and Agnis sets on
fire.–The cloud-forest, which the gods destroy.–The cloud-cow; the
cow-bow; the bird-thunderbolts; the birds come out of the cow.–The
monstrous cloud-cow, the wife of the monster.–Some
phenomena of the cloudy sky are analogous to those of the gloomy sky of
night and of winter.–The moment most fit for an epic poem is the meeting
of such phenomena in a nocturnal tempest.–The stars, cows put to flight
by the sun.–The moon, a milk-yielding cow.–The ambrosial moon fished up
in the fountain, gives nourishment to Indras.–The moon as a male, or
bull, discomfits, with the bull Indras, the monster.–The two bulls, or
the two stallions, the two horsemen, the twins.–The bull chases the wolf
from the waters.–The cow tied.–The aurora, or ambrosial cow, formed out
of the skin of another cow by the á¹ibhavas.–The á¹ibhavas, bulls and wise
birds.–The three á¹ibhavas reproduce the triple Indras and the triple
Vishá¹us; their three relationships; the three brothers, eldest, middle,
youngest; the three brother workmen; the youngest brother is the most
intelligent, although at first thought stupid; the reason why.–The three
brothers guests of a king.–The third of the á¹ibhavas, the third and
youngest son becomes Tritas the third, in the heroic form of Indras, who
kills the monster; Tritas, the third brother, after having accomplished
the great heroic undertaking, is abandoned by his envious brothers in
the well; the second brother is the son of the cow.–Indras a cowherd,
parent of the sun and the aurora, the cow of abundance, milk-yielding
and luminous.–The cow SÃ®tÃ¢.–Relationship of the sun to the aurora.–The
aurora as cow-nurse of the sun, mother of the cows; the aurora cowherd;
the sun hostler and cowherd.–The riddle of the wonderful cowherd; the
sun solves the riddle proposed by the aurora.–The aurora wins the race,
being the first to arrive at the barrier, without making use of her
feet.–The chariot of the aurora.–She who has no feet, who leaves no
footsteps; she who is without footsteps of the measure of the feet; she
who has no slipper (which is the measure of the foot).–The sun who never
puts his foot down, the sun without feet, the sun lame, who, during the
night, becomes blind; the blind and the lame who help each other, whom
Indra helps, whom the ambrosia of the aurora enables to walk and to
see.–The aurora of evening, witch who blinds the sun; the sun Indras, in
the morning, chases the aurora away; Indras subdues and destroys the
witch aurora.–The brother sun follows, as a seducer, the aurora his
sister, and wishes to burn her.–The sun follows his daughter the
aurora.–The aurora, a beautiful young girl, deliverer of the sun, rich
in treasure, awakener of the sleepers, saviour of mankind, foreseeing;
from small becomes large, from dark becomes brilliant, from infirm,
whole, from blind, seeing and protectress of sight.–Night and aurora,
now mother and daughter, now
sisters.–The luminous night a good sister; the gloomy night gives place
to the aurora, her elder or better sister, working, purifying,
cleansing.–The aurora shines only when near the sun her husband, before
whom she dances splendidly dressed; the aurora UrvaÃ§Ã®.–The wife of the
sun followed by the monster.–The husband of the aurora subject to the
same persecution. We are on the vast table-land of Central Asia; gigantic mountains
send forth on every side their thousand rivers; immense pasture-lands
and forests cover it; migratory tribes of pastoral nations traverse it;
the gopatis, the shepherd or lord of the cows, is the king; the
gopatis who has most herds is the most powerful. The story begins with a
graceful pastoral idyll. To increase the number of the cows, to render them fruitful in milk
and prolific in calves, to have them well looked after, is the dream,
the ideal of the ancient Aryan. The bull, the fÅ“cundator, is
the type of every male perfection, and the symbol of regal strength. Hence, it is only natural that the two most prominent animal figures
in the mythical heaven should be the cow and the bull. The cow is the ready, loving, faithful, fruitful Providence of the
shepherd. The worst enemy of the Aryan, therefore, is he who carries off the
cow; the best, the most illustrious, of his friends, he who is able to
recover it from the hands of the robber. The same idea is hence transferred to heaven; in heaven there is a
beneficent, fruitful power, which is called the cow, and a beneficent
fÅ“cundator of this same power, which is called the bull. The dewy moon, the dewy aurora, the watery cloud, the entire vault of
heaven, that giver of the quickening and benignant rain, that
benefactress of mankind,–are each, with special predilection,
represented as the beneficent cow of
abundance. The lord of this multiform cow of heaven, he who makes it
pregnant and fruitful and milk-yielding, the spring or morning sun, the
rain-giving sun (or moon) is often represented as a bull. Now, to apprehend all this clearly, we ought to go back, as nearly as
possible, to that epoch in which such conceptions would arise
spontaneously; but as the imagination so indulged is apt to betray us
into mere fantastical conceits, into an Ã  priori system, we
shall begin by excluding it entirely from these preliminary researches,
as being hazardous and misleading, and content ourselves with the
humbler office of collecting the testimonies of the poets themselves who
assisted in the creation of the mythology in question. I do not mean to say anything of the Vedic myths that is not taken
from one or other of the hymns contained in the greatest of the Vedas,
but only to arrange and connect together the links of the chain as they
certainly existed in the imagination of the ancient Aryan people, and
which the á¹igvedas, the work of a hundred poets and of several
centuries, presents to us as a whole, continuous and artistic. I shall
indeed suppose myself in the valley of KaÃ§mÃ®ra, or on the banks of the
Sindhus, under that sky, at the foot of these mountains, among these
rivers; but I shall search in the sky for that which I find in the
hymns, and not in the hymns for that which I may imagine I see in the
sky. I shall begin my voyage with a trusty chart, and shall consult it
with all the diligence in my power, in order not to lose any of the
advantages that a voyage so full of surprises has to offer. Hence the
notes will all, or nearly all, consist of quotations from my guide, in
order that the learned reader may be able to verify for himself every
separate assertion. And as to the frequent
stoppages we shall have to make by the way, let me ask the reader not to
ascribe these to anything arbitrary on my part, but rather to the
necessities of a voyage, made, as it is, step by step, in a region but
little known, and by the help of a guide, where nearly everything indeed
is to be found, but where, as in a rich inventory, it is easier to lose
one's way than to find it again. [1] The whole heavens being thus
represented as an infinite cow, it was natural that the principal and
most visible phenomena of the sky should become, in their turn, children
of the cow, or themselves cows or bulls, and that the

[2] But, since this great celestial cow
produces the tempestuous, noisy winds, she represents not only the
serene, tranquil vault of the shining sky, but also the cloudy and
tenebrous

mother
of storms. This great cow, this immense cloud, that occupies all the
vault of heaven and unchains the winds, is a brown, dark, spotted
(

[3] The singular has thus become a
plural; the male sons of the cloud, the winds, are 21; the daughters,
the clouds themselves, called the spotted ones (

[4] Evidently here the 3, or 7, or 21
sister cows that yield to the god of the eastern heavens their own
nutritious milk, and amidst whose milky humours the winds, now become
invulnerable, increase,

[5] fulfil the pious duties of
benevolent guardian fates. But if
the winds are sons of a cow, and the cows are their nurses, the winds,
or Marutas, must, as masculine, be necessarily represented as bulls. In
reality the Wind (

[6] the strength of the wind is compared
to that of the bull or the bear;

[7] the winds, as lusty as bulls,
overcome and subdue the dark ones. [8] Here, therefore, the clouds are no
longer represented as the cows that nurse, but with the gloomy aspect of
a monster. The Marutas, the winds that howl in the tempest, are as swift
as lightning, and surround themselves with lightning. Hence they are
celebrated for their luminous vestments; and hence it is said that the
reddish winds are resplendent with gems, as some bulls with stars. [9] As such–that is, as subduers of the
clouds, and as they who run impetuously through them–these winds, these
bulls, are the best friends, the most powerful helpers, of the great
bellowing bull; of the god of thunder and rain; of the sun, the
dispeller of clouds and darkness; of the supreme Vedic god, Indras, the
friend of light and ambrosia–of Indras, who brings with him daylight and
fine weather, who sends us the beneficent dew and the fertilising rain. Like the winds his companions, the sun Indras–the sun (and the luminous
sky) hidden in the dark, who strives to dissipate the

shadows,
the sun hidden in the cloud that thunders and lightens, to dissolve it
in rain–is represented as a powerful bull, as the bull of bulls,
invincible son of the cow, that bellows like the Marutas. [10]

[11] "Drink and grow,"

[12] one of the poets says to him, while
offering the symbolical libation of the cup of sacrifice, which is a
type of the cup of heaven, now the heavenly vault, now the cloud, now
the sun, and now the moon. From the sweet food of the celestial cow,
Indras acquires a swiftness which resembles that of the horse;

[13] and he eats and drinks at one time
enough to enable him to attain maturity at once. The gods give him three
hundred oxen to eat, and three lakes of ambrosial liquor

[14] to drink, in order that he may be
able to kill the monster serpent. The hunger and thirst of the heroes is
always proportioned to the miracle they are called upon to perform; and
for this reason the hymns of the

the
cloud as an immense great-bellied barrel (

[15]

[16] the splendid bull, with sharpened
horns, who is able of himself to overthrow all peoples. [17] But what are the horns of the bull
Indras, the god of thunder? Evidently the thunderbolts; Indras is, in
fact, said to sharpen the thunderbolts as a bull sharpens his
horns;

[18] the thunderbolt of Indras is said
to be thousand-pointed;

[19] the bull Indras is called the bull
with the thousand horns, who rises from the sea

[20] (or from the cloudy ocean as a
thunder-dealing sun, from the gloomy ocean as a radiant sun–the
thunderbolt being supposed to be rays from the solar disc). Sometimes
the thunderbolt of Indras is itself called a bull,

[21] and is sharpened by its beloved
refulgent cows,

[22] being used, now to withdraw the
cows from the darkness, now to deliver

them
from the monster of darkness that envelops them,

[23] and now to destroy the monster of
clouds and darkness itself. Besides the name of Indras, this exceedingly
powerful horned bull, who sharpens his horns to plunge them into the
monster, assumes also, as the fire which sends forth lightning, as that
which sends forth rays of light from the clouds and the darkness, the
name of Agnis; and, as such, has two heads, four horns, three feet,
seven hands, teeth of fire, and wings; he is borne on the wind, and
blows. [24]

Thus far, then, we have heavenly cows which nurture heavenly bulls,
and heavenly bulls and cows which use their horns for a battle that is
fought in heaven. Let us now suppose ourselves on the field of battle, and let us visit
both the hostile camps. In one we find the sun (and sometimes the moon),
the bull of bulls Indras, with the winds, Marutas, the radiant and
bellowing bulls; in the other, a multiform monster, in the shape of
wolves, serpents, wild boars, owls, mice, and such like. The bull Indras
has cows with him, who help him; the monster has also cows, either such
as he has carried off from Indras, and which he imprisons and secretes
in gloomy caverns, towers, or fortresses, or those which he caresses as
his own wives. In the one case, the cows consider the bull Indras as
their friend and liberating hero; in the other, those
with the monster are themselves monsters and enemies of Indras, who
fights against them. The clouds, in a word, are regarded at one time as
the friends of the rain-giving sun, who delivers them from the monster
that keeps back the rain, and at another as attacked by the sun, as they
who wickedly envelop him, and endeavour to destroy him. Let us now go on
to search, in the á¹igvedas, the proofs of this double
battle. To begin with the first phase of the conflict, where in the sky does
Indras fight the most celebrated of all his battles? [25] The cloud being compared to a
stone, a rock, or a mountain, it was natural,–1st, To imagine in the
rock or mountain dens or caverns, which, as they imprisoned cows, might
be likened to stables;

[26] 2d, To pass from the idea of a rock
to that of citadel, fortress, fortified city, tower; 3d, To pass from
the idea of a

mountain,
which is immovable, to that of a tree which, though it cannot move from
its place, yet rears itself and expands in the air; and from the idea of
the tree of the forest to the shadowy and awe-inspiring grove. Hence the
bull, or hero, or god Indras, or the sun of thunder, lightning, and
rain, now does battle within a cavern, now carries a fortified town by
assault, and now draws forth the cow from the forest, or unbinds it from
the tree, destroying the

The Vedic poetry celebrates, in particular, the exploit of Indras
against the cavern, enclosure, or mountain in which the monster (called
by different names and especially by those of Valas, Vá¹itras, Cushá¹as,
of enemy, black one, thief, serpent, wolf, or wild boar) conceals the
herds of the celestial heroes, or slaughters them. [27] the Marutas bulls ascend the
rock–now, by their own efforts, moving and making the sonorous stone,
the rock mountain, fall;

[28] now, with the iron edge of their
rolling chariots violently splitting the mountain;

[29] the valiant hero, beloved by the
gods, moves the stone;

[30] Indras hears the cows: by the aid
of the wind-bulls he

finds
the cows hidden in the cavern; he himself, furnished with an arm of
stone, opens the grotto of Valas, who keeps the cows; or, opens the
cavern to the cows; he vanquishes, kills, and pursues the thieves in
battle; the bulls bellow; the cows move forward to meet them; the bull,
Indras, bellows and leaves his seed in the herd; the thunder-dealing
male, Indras, and his spouse are glad and rejoice. [31]

In this fabled enterprise, three moments must be noted: 1st, The
effort to raise the stone; 2d, The struggle with the monster who carried
off the cows; 3d, The liberation of the prisoners. It is an entire epic
poem. The second form of the enterprise of Indras in the cloudy heavens is
that which has for its object the destruction of the celestial
fortresses, of the ninety, or ninety-nine, or hundred cities of
Ãambaras, of the cities which were the wives of the demons; and from
this undertaking Indras acquired the surname of puramdaras
(explained as destroyer of cities); although he had in it a most
valuable companion-in-arms, Agnis, that is, Fire, which naturally
suggests to our thoughts the notion of destruction by fire.[32]

the
monsters who restrain the milk in the breasts of the cows. [33] The clouded sky here figures in the
imagination as a great forest inhabited by

[34]

In this threefold battle of Indras, we must, moreover, remark a
curious feature. The thunder-dealing Indras overpowers his enemies with
arrows and darts; the same cloud which thunders, bellows, and therefore
is called a cow, becomes, as throwing darts, a bow: hence we have the
cow-bow, from which Indras hurls the iron stone, the thunderbolt; and
the cord itself of that bellowing bow is called a cow; from the bow-cow,
from the cord-cow, come forth the winged darts, the thunderbolts, called
birds, that eat men; and when they come forth, all the world
trembles.[35] We shall come upon the same idea
again further on. not
uncommon to see the cloud itself or the darkness, that is, the cow, the
fortress, or the forest represented as a monster. Thus, a Vedic hymn
informs us that the monster Valas had the shape of a cow;

[36] another hymn represents the cloud
as the cow that forms the waters, and that has now one foot, now four,
now eight, now nine, and fills the highest heaven with sounds;

[37] still another hymn sings that the
sun hurls his golden disc in the variegated cow;

[38] they who have been carried off, who
are guarded by the monster serpent, the waters, the cows, are become the
wives of the demons;

[39] and they must be malignant, since a
poet can use as a curse the wish that the malign spirits, the demons,
may drink the poison of those cows. [40] We have already seen that the
fortresses are wives of demons, and that the demons possessed the
forests. [41]

morning
and evening (of autumn and spring). We have here the same general
phenomenon of light and darkness engaged in strife; here, again, the sun
Indras is hidden, as though in a cloud, to prepare the light, to recover
from the monster of darkness the waters of youth and light, the riches,
the cows, which he keeps concealed; but this conquest is only made by
the hero after long wandering amidst many dangers, and is finally
accomplished by battles, in which the principal credit is often due to a
heroine; except in those cases, not frequent but well worthy of remark,
in which the clouds, hurricanes, tempests of lightning and thunderbolts,
coincide with the end of the night (or of winter), and the sun Indras,
by tearing the clouds, at the same time disperses the darkness of night
and brings dawn (or spring) back to the sky. In such coincidences, the
sun Indras, besides being the greatest of the gods, reveals himself to
be also the most epic of the heroes; the two skies, the dark and the
clouded, with their relative monsters, and the two suns, the thundering
and the radiant, with their relative companions, are confounded, and the
myth then assumes all its poetical splendour. And the most solemn
moments of the great national Aryan epic poems, the

[42] tells us that the clouds–the three
times seven spotted cows–cause their milk to drop to a god (whom, from
another similar passage,

[43]

we
know to be Indras, the sun) in the eastern sky (

Even the luminous night has its cows; the stars, which the sun puts
to flight with his rays,[44] are cows: the cows themselves,
whose dwellings the dwellings of the sun's cows must adjoin, are called
the many-horned ones.[45] These dwellings seem to me worthy
of passing remark, they
are the celestial houses that move, the enchanted huts and palaces that
appear, disappear, and are transformed so often in the popular stories
of the Aryans. [46] The moon and ambrosia in the word
indus, as well as somas, are confounded with one another; hence, Indras,

regent of the cold season). Indras and Somas (

[47] The word

Five bulls stand in the midst of the heavens, and chase out of the
way the wolf who crosses the waters;[48] the luminous Vasavas unbind the cow
that is tied by its foot.[49]

How now is this cow brought forth? to
give it life, cover it with the skin of a dead cow. [50] It being understood that the cow
Aurora (or Spring) dies at even (or in the autumn), the á¹ibhavas, the
threefold sun Indras,

[51] And the three á¹ibhavas may, it
seems to me, be the more easily identified with the triple Indras, with
Indra-Vishá¹us, who measures the world in three paces, since, as Indras
is called a bull, they also are called bulls;

[52] as Indras is often a falcon, they
also are named birds;

[53] and their miracles are sometimes
also those of Indras. This identification of the bulls á¹ibhavas, whom we
speak of here as producers of the cow Aurora (the same sterile cow of
the sleeping hero Ãayus, that which the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the two horsemen of the
twilight, restored to youth by the

á¹ibhavas,
rendered fruitful again),

[54] with the bull, or hero Indras,
appears to me to be of the greatest importance, inasmuch as it affords
us the key to much that is most vital to the Aryan legends. [55] The youngest of the three brothers
is therefore the most skilful. We find in the

[56] It would seem natural to recognise
in á¹ibhus, the protÃ©gÃ© of Indras, the most skilful of the three
brothers, who, as we have seen above, was the youngest; yet, as we
cannot infer anything from the order in which the hymns name the three
brothers–as,

in
one, VÃ¢Çµas is first named, then á¹ibhukshÃ¢, and finally Vibhvan; in
another, VÃ¢Çµas first, Vibhvan second, and á¹ibhus third;

[57] in another, again, á¹ibhus is
invoked first, then Vibhvan, and lastly VÃ¢Çµas; and as we also find all
the á¹ibhavas saluted under the common epithet of VÃ¢Çµas, and VÃ¢Çµas
himself by the name of Indras, or rather Indras saluted in his triple
form of á¹ibhus, Vibhvan, and VÃ¢Çµas,

[58] it remains uncertain which of these
was the proper name of the third brother of the á¹ibhavas. But what seems
to be sufficiently clear is, that Indras is identified with the á¹ibhavas
(

But
the

[60] that is to say, one relation is
Yamas, the elder brother; the second is the son of the cow, or the
second brother; the last is Tritas himself, or the youngest brother. This Tritas is called intelligent; he therefore corresponds to the third
brother, who makes four cups out of one. How then does he appear
sometimes stupid? The language itself supplies the explanation. In
Sanskrit,

proof
of strength great enough to disperse the darkness and the clouds, and
break the incantation; but, generally it is the third sun, the morning
sun, Indras in his third moment, Vishá¹us taking his third step,

[61] the third brother, Tritas, who
seems to obtain the victory, and deliver the young aurora from the
monster of night. All this seems to me to be very evident. [62] the victory of the young hero must
be achieved in the same way in which it is accomplished by Indras, his
more splendid and grandiose impersonation. But Tritas, or

[63] The sun has vanquished the monster
that kept the fountain of waters shut–he has unchained the waters, but
he himself has not been able to break through the cloud; he has
delivered from the dark and cloudy monster the princess, the dawn that
was to have been its prey, but he himself does not yet come forth–is
still invisible. Now, who are the enemies here that have placed the
young hero in the cistern, down into the well, in the sea? We have
already seen that Tritas has two brothers; and it is these two brothers
who, in a fit

of
jealousy, on account of his wife, the aurora, and the riches she brings
with her from the realm of darkness, the cistern or well, detain their
brother in the well,–all which is told us in a single but eloquent verse
of the Vedas. The intelligent Tritas in the well calls out
(

[64] and the two horsemen of the
twilight, the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, come to deliver the invoker (

[65] In another hymn, the deliverer
appears to be Bá¹ihaspatis, the lord of prayer, who having heard how
Tritas, thrust down into the well, was invoking the gods, made the large
from the small;

[66] that is to say, opened for the
young hero a way to escape from the well and show himself in his
glory. [67]

á¹ibhavas,
and both the former and the latter into an equally close connection with
the three moments of Indras. We have already said that the á¹ibhavas
created the cow; in the same way

[68] and Indras himself is the only lord
of the cows, the only real celestial shepherd;

[69] or, rather, it is he that begets
the sun and the aurora,

[70] or, as another hymn says, who gives
the horses and the sun and the cow of abundance. [71]

Here, therefore, the aurora is explicitly the cow of abundance; she
is still also the milk-giving and luminous cow, in which is found all
sweetness;[72] and finally, usrÃ¢ or
ushÃ¢ are two words, two appellations, which indiscriminately
express aurora and cow as the red or brilliant one. The identification
of the aurora with the cow, in the mythical sky of the Vedas, is
therefore a certainty. [73] the nourisher, the

[74] This Indras, protector and friend
of SÃ®tÃ¢, prepares therefore Vishá¹us, the protector, in the form of
RÃ¢mas, of his wife SÃ®tÃ¢. And

even
the á¹ibhavas are the protectors of the cow, as well as the
producers. [75]

But Indras, whose special function it is to lighten, to thunder, to
fight the monster of darkness, and to prepare the light, generally
figures in the popular imagination, at dawn (aurora), as the sun, under
his three names of SÃ»ryas, of á¹itas, and of
Savitar. The sun, with respect to the aurora, is now the father, now the
husband, now the son, and now the brother. As begotten of Indras
simultaneously with the aurora, he is the brother; as following and
embracing the aurora, he is the husband; as simply coming after the
aurora, he is the son; and as sending the cow or the aurora before him,
he is the father. These four relationships of the sun to the aurora or
dawn are all mentioned in the á¹igvedas. [76] that is, the whitish light of the
daybreak precedes in the eastern heavens the rosy light of aurora. The
aurora is the cow-nurse, and the oriental mother of the old sun; at the
sound of the hymn in praise of the dawn, the two horsemen of twilight,
the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, awaken. [77] Two cows–[

therefore
be sometimes identified with the two morning dawns, the white dawn
(alba) or daybreak, and the red dawn (aurora), and, from another point
of view, the lunar dawn and the solar one]–drop milk towards the sun, in
the heaven. [78] The aurora is the mother of the
cows. [79]

[80] with songs. The red rays of the
high sun fly and join themselves to the sun's cows. [81] The seven wise

[82] represents him) celebrate in their
songs the herds of cows which belong to the aurora, who appears upon the
mountain. [83] Let us notice more particularly
what is said of the aurora that appears with the cows upon the mountain. It is the sun that enables the AÃ±girasas to split the mountain, to
bellow along with the cows, and to surround themselves with the
splendour of the aurora. [84] The aurora, the daughter of the
sky, the splendid one, appears; at the same time, the sun draws up the
cows. [85] The aurora is carried by red
luminous cows, whilst the . sun,
the hero-archer, kills the enemies. [86] The aurora breaks open the prison
of the cows; the cows exult towards the aurora;

[87] the aurora comes out of the
darkness as cows come out of their stable. [88] As the solar hero, Indras, is the
guardian or shepherd of horses and of cows,

[89] so the auroras are often celebrated
in the

[90]

[91] and the sun is represented to us in
the following riddle as a wonderful cowherd:–"I have seen a shepherd who
never set down his foot, and yet went and disappeared on the roads; and
who, taking the same and yet different roads, goes round and round
amidst the worlds."

[92] The sun goes round in the ether,
and never puts down a foot, for he has none; and he takes the same, yet
different, roads in the sky,

riddle
is, in the

[93] He who solves this enigma we may be
sure is Mitras, the sun, who recognises the aurora, the girl who comes
making use of feet, although she seem to have none, for she comes borne
in a chariot, of which the wheels appear to be feet, which is the same
luminous chariot that rolls well,

[94] given by the á¹ibhavas to the two
horsemen AÃ§vinÃ¢u (represented sometimes as two old men made young again
by the á¹ibhavas, and sometimes simply as two handsome youths), into
which chariot she mounts by the help of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u; and the daughter of
the sun is, in the race, the first to come to the winning-post, amid the
enthusiastic plaudits of the gods. [95] Then the hymns to the aurora
sometimes represent that vast chariot as belonging to the eastern
aurora, who guides a hundred chariots, and who, in turn, helps the
immortal gods to ascend into the chariot beside her. [96] The aurora, as the first of those
who appear every day in the eastern sky, as the first to know the break
of day,

[97] is naturally represented as one of
the swiftest

among
those who are the guests of the sun-prince during the night; and like
her cows, which do not cover themselves with dust (this being an
attribute which, in the Indian faith, distinguishes the gods from
mortals, for the former walk in the heavens, and the latter upon earth),
she, in her onward flight, leaves no footsteps behind her. The word

became also blind. In one hymn, the blind and the lame are not one, but
two, whom propitious Indras guides;

[98] in another, the blind-lame is one
person, with the name of

[99] The lame one who sees, shows the
way to the blind who is able to walk, or the lame carries the blind;
Indras, the hidden sun, guides the blind and the lame; or, the blind and
the lame, lost in the forest, help each other; in the morning, the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the two horsemen, friends of the aurora, with the water of
sight and of strength (that is, PÃ¡ravá¹ig, the blind-lame having
discovered the hidden fountain of the young girls of the dawn,

[100] with the ambrosia of the aurora,
with the aurora itself), make the blind see, and him who has no feet,
the lame, walk; that is, they burst forth into the upper air again,
transfigured now into the luminous sun who sets out on his heavenly
voyage. I have said above that the hero becomes blind and lame through
the perfidy and magic of the evening aurora: nor was the assertion
unfounded; for the Vedic hymn in which Indras guides the blind and the
lame,

upon
the aurora of the morning, for the wrong done him by the aurora of the
evening, beautiful, but faithless. [101] This aurora, this virago, this
Amazon, this Vedic Medea, who, treacherously plunging her husband, or
brother, the solar hero, into a fiery furnace, blinds and lames him, is
punished in the morning for her crime of the evening. The hero
vanquishes her, overcomes her incantations, and annihilates her. The
Vedic hymn sings–"A manly and heroic undertaking thou hast accomplished,
O Indras, for an evil-doing woman, the daughter of the heavens, thou
hast smitten; the growing daughter of the heaven, the aurora, O Indras,
thou hast destroyed; from the chariot, broken in pieces, fell the
aurora, trembling, because the bull had struck her."

[102] Here the mythical animal reappears
on the same stage with the heroes, and for the image of the hero and the
heroine there is substituted that of the cow and the bull. [103]

One
Vedic hymn advises the aurora not to stretch out the web she works at
too far, lest the sun, like a robber, with hostile intention, set fire
to and burn her. [104] Another hymn tells us that the
handsome one follows the beautiful one, the brother the sister, like a
lover,

[105]–the aurora fleeing from the sun,
her brother, out of shame, and her brother following her, actuated by a
brutal instinct. Finally, a third hymn shows us the Vedic Vulcan, the
blacksmith of the gods, the sun Tvashá¹­ar, called also the omniform sun
(

[106]

who
liberates the sun; and we have already seen the aurora making the
ambrosial milk drop for the sun from her cows, and the sun drawing up
and delivering the cows of the aurora. There is a hymn in which the
divine girl, the aurora, comes up in the east, with a lascivious air,
smiling, fresh, uncovering her bosom, resplendent, towards the god who
sacrifices himself,

[107] that is to say, towards the sun,
towards

[108] invokes her, the well-known legend
of which, narrated in the

[109] that is to say, she protects
mortals from death, and resuscitates them; she sees and foresees
everything. [110] The awakener is also the awakened;
the illuminator

is
also the illumined, or the wise; and the illumined or luminous one is
also the beautiful one. From being small, she is become large

[111] (the heroes and heroines of
mythology are only small at birth, and pass at once into fulness of
stature); from being infirm and sombre-visaged, by the grace of Indras
and of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, she is cured and restored to strength and
clearness. [112] But why was she dark at first? Because her mother, the night, is the black one; she, the white one, is
born of the black one. [113]

During the night, the young girl was blind, and she recovers her
sight by the grace of a wise one, one who, protected by Indras, another
shape of Indras, has become enamoured of her. We have seen above that it
is the AÃ§vinÃ¢u who, with the aurora, give back to the sun his sight;
here it is the sun who makes the aurora see, it is the sun who gives her
light; and she who, having been blind, recovers her sight, becomes the
protectress of the blind and preserver of vision,[114] like St Lucia, virgin and martyr,
in the Christian Mythology. Physical truth and the mythical narration
are in perfect accordance. one
goes while the other comes. [115] Another hymn sings of them thus:
"The brilliantly-decked one approaches, the white aurora comes; the
black one prepares for her her rooms. The one immortal having joined the
other, the two appear alternately in the heavens. One and eternal is the
path of the two sisters; they follow it, one after the other, guided by
the gods; they do not meet, and they never stand still–the two good
nurses, night and aurora, one in soul yet different in form."

[116] The two good nurses, night and
aurora, whose hues alternate eternally, nourish between them one and the
same child (the sun). [117] But the

[118] Here probably we must understand
by the proper sister of the aurora the luminous or moonlight night, and
by the half-sister, the gloomy night, the night without a moon. This is
the sister whom, in a hymn, the aurora removes, sends far away from her,
while she shines to be seen of her husband;

[119] and her half-sister, the night, is
obliged to resign her place to her elder or better sister,

[120] the word

best. We have already seen that the aurora is the first to appear; as such,
and as she who in the evening precedes the night (the evening aurora),
she is the first-born, the eldest, the most experienced, the best;
while, from another point of view, she is represented to us as the
little one who becomes great, and, in this case, as younger sister of
the night (the morning dawn). The dawns, or auroras, are saluted with
the epithet of workwomen,

[121] just as the good sister, with
respect to the bad one, is always she who works, doing wonderful work,
that is, spinning or weaving the rosy cloth. But the auroras are not
only the workers, they are also the pure purifying and cleansing
ones;

[122] hence one can understand how one
of the tasks imposed upon the youngest sister was that of purifying,
purging, or separating the grain during the night, taking from it all
that is impure, in which task she is assisted sometimes by a good fairy,
sometimes by the Virgin Mary, who, according to all probability, is the
moon. [123] united, in her splendour, with the
rays of the sun,

[124] like a wife she prepares the
dwelling of the sun. [125] Very brilliant, like a wife
cleansed by her mother, she uncovers her body;

[126] like a bather who shows

herself,
the shining one unveils her body;

[127] she adorns herself like a dancer,
uncovering, like a cow, her breast;

[128] she displays her luminous
garments;

[129] all-radiant, with beautiful face,
she laughs;

[130] and he who has made the aurora
laugh, her, the beautiful princess, who, at first, that is, during the
night, did not laugh, espouses her; the sun espouses the aurora. [131] thereupon UrvaÃ§Ã® suddenly abandons
her husband PurÃ»ravas, because he breaks an agreement made between them. We shall see further on in this chapter what this agreement was. Besides, having given him a son before her departure, she consoles him
by permitting him to come and find her again in heaven, that is, by
endowing the sun with the immortality she possesses herself. In the
morning the aurora precedes

the
sun; he follows her too closely, and she disappears, but leaves a son,

All these alternative variations of a mythical representation become
each in turn a legend by itself, as we shall see again more in detail,
when the study of the different animals that take part in them shall
furnish us with opportunities of doing so. In the meantime, we have here
finished our enumeration of all that in the hymns of the
á¹igvedas refers in any way to the bull and the cow,–to the
wind, moon, and sun bulls, to the cow-cloud, moon, spring and
aurora,–leaving it, however, to be understood how natural it is to pass
from the bull to the handsome hero-prince, and from the cow to the
beautiful girl, the rich princess, the valiant heroine, or the wise
fairy. For though in the mythical hymns of the á¹igvedas we have
little more than hints or foreshadows of the many popular legends which
we have thus referred to, often without naming them, these are so many
and so precise that it seems
to me to be almost impossible not to recognise them. To demonstrate
this, however, it will be necessary for me to show further what form the
mythological ideas and figures relating to the animals dispersed in the
Vedic hymns afterwards assumed in the Hindoo traditions. SECTION II. The Worship of the Bull and of the Cow in India,

signification of these prodigies.–The wind runs after women.–Conclusion
of the study of the myth and of the legends which refer to the bull and
the cow of India. Just as the importance of the cattle to primitive and pastoral Aryan
life explains the propensity of the Aryan mind to conceive of the mobile
phenomena of the heavens, at first considered living beings, as bulls
and cows, so the consecration of these animals, associated and
identified with the celestial phenomena and the gods, naturally gave
rise to the superstitious worship of the bull and the cow, common to all
the Aryan nations, but particularly, through the intervention of the
brÃ¢hmanic priests, to the Hindoos. [132]

[133]), which therefore it was a crime
to kill. [134] An interesting chapter of the

[135] on the sacrifice of animals, shows
us how, next to man, the horse was the supreme sacrifice offered to the
gods; how the cow afterwards took the place of the horse; the sheep, of
the cow; the goat, of the sheep; and, at last, vegetable products were
substituted for animals;–a substitution or cheating of the gods in the
sacrifice, which, perhaps, serves to explain even more the fraud of
which, in popular stories, the simpleton is

always
the victim; the simpleton here being the god himself, and the cheater
man, who changes, under a sacred pretext, the noblest and most valued
animals for common and less valuable ones, and finally for vegetables
apparently of no value whatever. In the Hindoo codes of law we have the
same fraudulent substitution of animals under a legal pretext. "The
killer of a cow," says the code attributed to

[136] "must stay a month in penitence,
drinking the

[137] are milk, curds, butter, urine,
and dung), sleeping in a stable and following the cows; and he must
purify himself by the gift of another cow." Thus, according to

[138] the killer of a parrot is purified
by giving a two-year-old calf; the killer of a crane by giving a calf
three years old; the killer of an ass, a goat, or a sheep, by the gift
of a bull; the killer of an elephant by the gift of five black bulls
(

[139] Another interesting verse of

[140] tells us they die pure who are
killed by lightning or in battle for the sake of the cows or the
brÃ¢hmans. The cow was often the object heroes fought for in heaven; the
BrÃ¢hman wished to be the object heroes should fight for upon earth. We
learn from the domestic ceremonies referred to by

[141] we find the bull's hide stretched
out near the nuptial hearth, the wife seated upon it, and the husband,
touching his wife, saying, "May the lord of all creatures allow us to
have children;"–words taken from the Vedic nuptial hymn. [142] We have seen above how the
á¹ibhavas, from the hide of a dead cow, formed a new and beautiful one,
or, in other words, how, from the dusk of evening, by stretching it in
the night, they formed the dawn of morning. This cow's hide plays also
an important

[143] is the garment of the god Vishá¹us;
and the goÄarman divided into thongs, and afterwards fastened to each
other, served formerly in India to measure the circumference of a piece
of ground;

[144] hence the cow's hide suggested the
idea of a species of infinity. Further on we shall find it put to
extraordinary uses in western legend; we find it even in the hymns of
the Vedic age used to cover the body of a dead man, the fire being
invoked not to consume it, almost as if the cow's hide had the virtue of
resuscitating the dead. [145]

The
cow, being the symbol of fruitfulness, was also the companion of the
wife during pregnancy. [146] tells us how, in the third month,
the husband was to give his wife to drink of the sour milk of a cow that
has a calf like itself, and in it two beans and a grain of barley; the
husband was then to ask his wife three times, "What drinkest thou?" and
she was to answer three times: "The generation of males." In the fourth
month, the wife, according to

[147] and a bull, during the Vedic
period, was the gift which sufficed for the priest. In the Vedic
antiquity, neither bulls nor cows were allowed to go to pasture without
some special augury, which, in the domestic ceremonials of

[148] has been also handed down to us;
the cows were to give milk and honey, for the strength and increase of
whoever possessed them. Here we have again the cows not only as the
beneficent, but as the strong ones, they who help the hero or the
heroine who takes them to pasture. But although beautiful cows, when seen by day, are a sign of good
luck, seen in dreams they are of evil omen; for in that case they are of
course the black cows, the shadows of night, or the gloomy waters of the
nocturnal ocean. Already in the á¹igvedas, the dawn, or the luminous cow, comes
to deliver the fore-mentioned solar hero, Tritas Aptyas, from the evil
sleep which he sleeps amidst the cows[149] of night. ÃÃ§valÃ¢yaá¹as, in
his turn, recommends us when we have an evil dream, to invoke the sun,
to hasten the approach of the morning, or, better still, to recite the
hymn of five verses to the dawn which we have already referred to, and
which begins with the words, "And like an evil dream amidst the cows."
Here the belief is not yet an entirely superstitious one; and we
understand what is meant by the cows who envelop us in the sleep of
night, when we are told to invoke the sun and the dawn to come and
deliver us from them. [150] And even the gloomy nocturnal
kingdom of Yamas, the god of the dead, has its cows of black appearance,
which are nevertheless milk-yielding; and thus the black cow of the
funeral sacrifices comes to forebode resurrection. In the
same way the viaticum, or provision of food for his journey, given to
the dead man is a symbol of his resurrection. The journey being
considered as a short one, the provision of food which is to sustain the
traveller to the kingdom of the dead is limited, and each dead hero
carries it with him, generally not so much for himself, as to ensure a
passage into the kingdom of the dead. For this reason we read, even in
the domestic ceremonials of

[151] what is the greatest symbol of
strength, the reins of the animal killed in the funeral sacrifice (or,
in default of an animal victim, at least two cakes of rice or of flour),
in order that the dead man may throw them down the throats of the two
Cerberi, the two sons of the bitch

They who return from the funeral must touch the stone of Priapus, a
fire, the excrement of a cow,[152] a grain of barley, a grain of
sesame and water,–all symbols of that fecundity which the contact with a
corpse might have destroyed. The Vedic hymns have shown us the principal mythical aspects and
functions of the cow and the bull; we have also seen how the brÃ¢hmanic
codes confirmed, by the sanction of law, the worship of these animals,
and how jealously the domestic tradition of the Hindoos has guarded
it. Let us now see from the Ãitareya-brÃ¢hmaá¹am, how the
BrÃ¢hmans themselves, those of the era immediately following that of the
VedÃ¢s, interpreted the myth of the cow. We have recognised in the Vedic heavens, as reflected in the hymns of
the á¹igvedas, three cows–the cow-cloud, the cow-moon, and the
cow-aurora. These three cows, and especially the first and the third,
are also quite distinct from one another in the
Ãitareya-brÃ¢hmaá¹am. [153] (or that one must sing to the
cloud that it may fertilise the pastures and fields with rain), and how
one must sacrifice a bull to

[154] or the monster who keeps the rain
in the cloud. [155] and the aurora with the cow. [156] It tells us explicitly that the
characteristic form of the aurora is the red cow, because she moves with
the red cows. [157] The gods, after having discovered
the cows in the cavern, open the cavern with the third libation of the
morning;

[158] when the cows come out, the gods,
the

forth
of the gods (

[159]

[160] the benefits received from a holy
hermit, called MataÃ±gas, are compared to those of a

[162] the sun is born of the cows
(

mother
she naturally nourishes him with her milk; hence the same

[163] tells us that the gods Mitras and
Varuá¹as, by means of the curdled milk, took from the drink of the gods
the inebriating poison which the long-tongued witch
(

[164] But in the sky, where the
ambrosial milk and the health-giving herbs are produced, there are gods
and demons; and the milk, which is at one time the rain, at another
ambrosia, is now in the cloud, now in the moon (called also

[165]), which two words are used

synonymously. Here the milky, ambrosial, and healthful humour is supposed to be
produced, not by a cow, but by an herb. And the gods and demons contend
in heaven for the possession of this herb, as well as for the ambrosia;
the only difference being that the gods enjoy both one and the other
without corrupting them, whilst the demons poison them as they drink
them; that is to say, they spread darkness over the light, they move
about in the darkness, in the gloomy waters, in the black humour which
comes out of the herb itself, which, in contact with them, becomes
poisonous, so that they in turn suck the poison. On the other hand, the

[166] an amphibious race, in whom at one
time the nature of the gods predominates, at another that of the demons,
and who consequently take now the side of the gods, now that of the
demons, are simply guards who, as against theft, keep watch and ward
over the perfumes and healthful herbs, which are their own property, and
the healthful or ambrosial waters, the ambrosia which belongs to their
wives, the nymphs; they are, in a word, the earliest representatives of
the enjoying and jealous proprietor. We have already heard, in the

interesting Hindoo proverb, "The grass gives the milk to the cows, and
the milk gives the poison to the serpents."

[167] It is indeed the milk of the cow
of the dawn and of the cow of the moon which destroys the serpents of
darkness, the demoniacal shadows of night. [168] The humours of the cow have passed
to the herb, and from the herb to the pearl; and the naturalness of this
figure recommends itself to our modern conception, for when we would
describe a diamond or other gem as of the purest quality, we say it is a
diamond or gem of the first water. Even the pearl-moon and the
pearl-sun, from their ambrosial humours, have a fine water. In the

[169] at the moment of production of
ambrosia from the stirring up of the milky sea, we see, near the
healthful herb, the gem

[170] is saluted by the name of

who
has horns of pearls. [171] In the

[172] the bright-shining grass and the
solar disc appear together on the summit of the mountain GandhamÃ¢danas;
no sooner does he smell its odour than the solar hero

[173] the sun

The aurora who possesses the pearl becomes she who is
rich in pearls, and herself a source of pearls; but the pearl, as we
have already seen, is not only the sun, it is also the moon. The moon is
the friend of the aurora; she comforts her in the evening under her
persecutions; she loads her with presents during the night, accompanies
and guides her, and helps her to find her husband. [174] Here we have the moon personified
as a marvellous workwoman, a fairy with golden fingers, a good fairy;
and in this character we find her again in the

[175] in all which the fairy moon
appears as working during the night for the aurora, preparing her
luminous garments–the two garments, of which the one is for the evening
and the other for the morning, one lunar and of

silver,
the other solar and of gold–in order that she may please her husband
RÃ¢mas, or the sun Vishá¹us, who is glad when he sees her thus adorned. In

moon can be recognised in the benignant fairies

[177] at the time when SuramÃ¢ announces
to SÃ®tÃ¢ the approach of RÃ¢mas, SÃ®tÃ¢ shines by her own beauty, like the
opening dawn;

[178] finally, SaramÃ¢ (who seems to be
the same as SuramÃ¢), whom SÃ®tÃ¢ calls her twin-sister
(

[179] As to TriÇµaá¹­Ã¢, it is not difficult
to recognise in her the moon, when we remember that TrÇµiaá¹­as is a name
which is frequently given to the evening sun, or rising moon,

in his search of SÃ®tÃ¢, is said to shine like a white bull with a

as a horned animal, and to the cornucopia. Moreover, we find the same
lunar horn again in the city of

[183] and RÃ¢mas and Bharatas take their
departure in the morning from Guhas, who is said to wander always in the
forests. [184] Now, this Guhas, who, though
always hidden, yet wishes to entertain the solar hero during the night
with presents of the town of Ãá¹iÃ±gaveram, appears to me to be just
another form of the solar hero himself, who enters and hides himself in
the night, hospitably received in the lunar habitation, another form of
the god Indras, whom we have seen in the

united
during the night to Indus or Somas–that is, to the moon–and who, in the

[185], when SÃ®tÃ¢ is in the power of the
monster, comes down during the night to console her, lulls her keepers
to sleep, and nourishes her with the ambrosial milk (with Soma, the
moon, the same moon which, in the

But it remains to us to adduce clearer evidence to show that in the
RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am RÃ¢mas is the sun, and SÃ®tÃ¢ the dawn, or aurora. Without taking into account that RÃ¢mas is the most popular
personification of Vishá¹us, and that Vishá¹us is often the solar hero
(although he is not seldom identified with the moon), let us see how
RÃ¢mas manifests himself, and what he does in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am to
vindicate especially his solar nature. [186] Hanumant amuses himself with the
monsters, as the wind with the archer-clouds of the thousand-eyed
Indras;

[187] and it is said that RÃ¢mas gets on

Hanumant's
back, as Indras does on the elephant

[188] But the bull Indras is reproduced
in the bull RÃ¢mas, and the monkeys who assist RÃ¢mas have kept at least
the tail of the Vedic cows, the helpers of Indras, whence their generic
name of

[189] The bow with which RÃ¢mas shoots
the monsters is made of a horn, whence his name of

[190] RÃ¢mas receives the shower of
hostile darts, as a bull upon its horns the abundant rains of
autumn. [191] SÃ®tÃ¢ herself calls both her RÃ¢mas
and his brother Lakshmaá¹as by the name of

[192] or the lion and the bull, which
are conjoined so frequently in the mythology, on account of equal
strength; hence the terror of the lion when he hears the bull bellow in
the first book of the

[193] and others, show

us the
nature of the battle. In the battle-field of RÃ¢mas, instead, the
assisting hero is now a bull (

[194] Indras, in the

[195] The field of this epic battle is
evidently the same as that of the mythical battle of Indras. And in the

[196] The name of wanderer by night
(

[197] and

the
monster

[198] shows us that the epic poem of
RÃ¢mas embraces, besides the nightly battle of the sun over darkness,
also the great annual battle of the sun in winter to recover and rejoin
the spring. Anyhow, it is always a battle of the sun against the monster
of darkness. RÃ¢mas, in the very beginning of the great poem, says to his
brother Lakshmaá¹as:–"See, O Lakshmaá¹as, MÃ¢riÄas is come here with his
followers, making a noise like thunder, and with him the wanderer by
night SubÃ¢hus; thou wilt see them to-day, like a mass of dark clouds,
dispersed by me in a moment, like clouds by the wind."

[199] Here we find almost the whole
battle of Indras. [200] Heroes and monsters combat with
stones and rocks from the great mountain, and fall, overthrown on the
earth, like mountains. The monster RÃ¢vaá¹as carries off SÃ®tÃ¢ with the
magic of the wind and the tempest. [201] Heroes and monsters fight with
trunks of trees from the great forest; moreover, the trunks themselves,
having become monsters, join the fray, stretch out their strange arms,
and devour the hero in their cavities. And here we come upon the
interesting legend of

again the forests and trees combating, and the barrel of the VedÃ¢s

[202] in the forms of sounding barrels. In the

[203] In Tuscany, we say of water that
gushes copiously out of a reservoir, that it pours as from a barrel's
mouth. The monster Kabandhas draws towards himself, with his long arms,
the two brothers RÃ¢mas and Lakshmaá¹as (compared several times in the

[204] to the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u, who resemble
each other in everything). RÃ¢mas and Lakshmaá¹as,

by the
two brothers, the monster is disenchanted from this malediction, and
having resumed his form of a splendid demon, he ascends to heaven in a
luminous form. Here we have the all-radiant sun shut up in the cloud, he
being the yellow eye, the burning mouth, of Kabandhas, and, in union
with the cloud, forming a hideous monster; the hero comes to destroy his
monstrous form, and the monster thanks him, for thus he becomes the
glorious god, the splendid being, the handsome prince he was before. RÃ¢mas who delivers Kabandhas from his monstrous form by cutting off his
two arms, is the sun RÃ¢mas coming forth from the gloomy forest, and
uncovering the sky in the east and in the west. RÃ¢mas delivering
Kabandhas is simply the sun delivering himself from the monster of gloom
and cloud that envelops him. And, indeed, the greater part of the myths
have their origin in the plurality of appellations given to the same
phenomenon. Each appellation grows into a distinct personality, and the
various personalities fight with each other. Hence the hero who delivers
himself becomes the deliverer of the hero, viewed as a different person
from the hero; the monstrous form which envelops the hero is often his
own malediction; the hero who comes to kill this monstrous form is his
benefactor. [205]

[206] which, after being killed by
RÃ¢mas, re-ascends to heaven in a luminous form; of the sea-monster,
which Hanumant destroys, and restores to its primitive form, that of a
celestial nymph; of the old ÃavarÃ®, who, after having seen RÃ¢mas,
sacrifices herself in the fire, and

re-ascends
young and beautiful to heaven (the usual Vedic young girl, the dawn
whom, ugly during the night, Indras, by taking off her ugly skin,
restores to beauty in the morning); an episodical variation of what
afterwards happens to SÃ®tÃ¢ herself, who, having been ugly when in the
power of the monster RÃ¢vaá¹as, recovers her beauty by the sacrifice of
fire, in order to prove her innocence to her husband RÃ¢mas, and shines
again a young girl, like the young sun, adorned with burning gold, and
wearing a red dress;

[207] and when RÃ¢mas comes near (like
the young dawn, when she sees her husband), she resembles the first
light (PrabhÃ¢), the wife of the sun. [208] This SÃ®tÃ¢, daughter of Ç´anakas
(the generator), whom the

[209] or the sun, seems to me to be no
other than the dawn, the daughter of light, the daughter of Indras, the
god of the Vedic texts. These, indeed, sometimes represent SÃ»ryÃ¢, the
daughter of the sun, as the lover of the moon (who is then masculine);
but we find more frequently the loves of the dawn and the sun, of the
beautiful heroine and the splendid solar hero, while the moon is
generally the brother, or the pitying sister of the hero and the
heroine, the beneficent old man, the foreseeing fairy, the good hostess,
who aids them in their enterprises; although we also find the dawn as a
sister of the sun and his succourer. In fact, the Buddhist tradition of
the legend of RÃ¢mas, illustrated by Weber,

[210] represents SÃ®tÃ¢ to us as the
sister of the two

brothers
RÃ¢mas and Lakshmaá¹as, who go into banishment for twelve years to escape
the persecutions of their cruel step-mother (of whom the

[211] not only does not exclude her
relationship with the dawn, but confirms it; for we have seen the dawn
rise from the mountain, as the daughter of light and the sun, whom the
young sun wins for his bride, as a reward for his wonderful skill as an
archer against the monsters of darkness; and we have seen that the dawn
marries only her predestined husband, and her predestined husband is he
who performs the greatest miracles, restores her lost gaiety, and most
resembles her. We have just seen the old ÃavarÃ® and the ugly SÃ®tÃ¢, at
the sight of the sun RÃ¢mas, deliver themselves in the fire from every
mortal danger, and become beautiful and happy once more. But the concord between the mythical husband and wife is not more
steadfast than that of mortal couples. RÃ¢mas is very apt to be
suspicious. Having returned to his kingdom of AyodhyÃ¢, he allows himself
to brood upon what his subjects may say of him for having taken back his
wife, after she had been in the hands of the monster (they were not
present at the first fire-sacrifice of SÃ®tÃ¢); RÃ¢mas reveals his
suspicions to SÃ®tÃ¢, and blames the evil-speaking of the citizens for
originating them; she submits a
second time to the trial by fire, but, offended by his continual
suspicions, she flees from her husband, and on a car of light, drawn by
serpents (PannagÃ¢s), goes down again underground (which appears
to mean simply this–the dawn, or spring, marries the sun in the morning,
or she stays all day, or all summer, in his kingdom, and in the evening,
or in the autumn, goes down into the shades of night, or of
winter).[212] It is an indiscretion of the
husband which causes his wife to abandon him. [213] the king PurÃ»ravas loses his wife
UrvaÃ§Ã®, because he has let it be known in heaven that she was with him;
in KÃ¢lidÃ¢sas's drama of

[214] The wise and splendid ÃÃ¢ntanus
goes to the chase on the banks of the GaÃ±gÃ¢, and there finds a beautiful
nymph whom he becomes enamoured of. The nymph responds to his suit, and
consents to remain with him, on condition that he will never say
anything displeasing

to
her, whatever she may do or meditate; and the enamoured king assents to
the grave condition. They live together happily, for the king yields to
the nymph in everything; but in the course of time, eight sons are born
to them; the nymph has already thrown seven into the river, and the
king, although inwardly full of grief, dares not say anything to her;
but when she is about to throw the last one in, the king implores her
not to do it, and challenges her to say who she is. The nymph then
confesses to him that she is the GaÃ±gÃ¢ itself personified, and that the
eight sons born to their loves are human personifications of the eight
divine Vasavas, who, by being thrown into the GaÃ±gÃ¢, are liberated from
the curse of the human form: the only Vasus who is pleased to remain
among men is DyÃ¢us (the sky), in the form of the eunuch BhÃ®shmas, whom
ÃÃ¢ntanus would not allow to be thrown into the waters. The same curse
falls upon the Vasavas for having ravished the cow of abundance from the
penitent Apavas. We shall find a legendary subject analogous to this one
of ÃÃ¢ntanus in several of the popular tales of Europe, with this
difference that, in European tradition, it is generally the husband who
abandons his indiscreet partner. The Hindoo tradition, however, also
offers us an example of the husband who abandons his wife, in the wise
Ç´aratkarus, who marries the sister of the king of the serpents, on
condition that she never does anything to displease him. [215] One day the wise man sleeps;
evening comes on; he ought to be awakened in order to say his evening
prayers; if he does not say them, he does not do his duty, and she would
do wrong did she not warn him. If she awaken him, he

will
be enraged. What is to be done? She takes the latter course. The wise
man awakes, becomes enraged, and abandons her, after she had given him a
son. [216]

[217] and by Professor Max MÃ¼ller,

[218] who translated it from the

[219] obliges him to promise that he
will sacrifice to him whatever is born to him. The king promises; a
child is born, who is named the red (Rohitas). Varuá¹as

claims
him; the father begs him to wait till the child has cut his teeth, then
till his first teeth are cast, then till he is able to bear armour. It
is evident that the father wishes to wait till his son be strong enough
to defend himself against his persecutor, Varuá¹as. Varuá¹as thereupon
claims him in a more resolute manner, and HariÃ§Äandras informs the son
himself that he must be given up in sacrifice. Rohitas takes his bow and
flees into the woods, where he lives by the chase. This first part of
the legend corresponds with those numerous European popular tales, in
which, now the devil, now the aquatic monster, now the serpent, demands
from a father the son who has just been born to him without his
knowledge. The second part of the story of Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas shows us the hero
in the forest; he has taken his bow with him, and hence, like RÃ¢mas in
the

praise heaped upon him, concedes to him a golden chariot, upon which,
with praises to the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, and help from the dawn, Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, unbound
from the fetters of Varuá¹as, is delivered. These fetters of Varuá¹as,
which imprison the victim, bound and sacrificed by his own father, help
us to understand the second part of the European popular tale of the son
sacrificed against his will to the demon by his father; for Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas,
towards the end of the European story, takes the form of a horse,
Varuá¹as that of a demon, and the fetters of Varuá¹as are the bridle of
the horse, which the imprudent father sells to the demon, together with
his son in the shape of a horse;

[220] the beautiful daughter of the
demon (the white one, who, as usual, comes out of the black monster)
delivers the young man transformed into a horse; as in the Vedic story
of Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, it is explicitly the dawn who is the young girl that
delivers. [221] Varuá¹as is called in the

[222] Evidently, Varuá¹as is here, not a
different form, but a different name of the god Yamas, the pÃ¢Ã§in, or
furnished with rope, the constrictor

gloomy
god who sits on the mountain, who invests and surprises the solar hero,
and drags him into his kingdom. As to HariÃ§Äandras and AÄ¡igartas,
Rohitas and Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, they appear, in my opinion, to be themselves
different names for not only the same celestial phenomenon, but the same
mythical personage. HariÃ§Äandras is celebrated in the legends as a solar
king; Rohitas, his son, the red one, is his

[223] has given us a third name for the
same unnatural father,

[224] in ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras, who asks his own
sons to sacrifice themselves, instead of Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, who is under his
protection, and as they refuse to obey, he curses them. [225] proves these identities, and adds
a new and notable particular. The wife of ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras designs, on
account of her poverty, to barter her middle son for a hundred cows, and
with that view already keeps him tied with a rope like a slave. The
grandfather of Rohitas, HariÃ§Äandras's father, TriÃ§aÃ±kus, wanders
through the woods, and delivers this son of ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras, whose family he
thenceforth protects and maintains. The deeds of TriÃ§aÃ±kus, who begs of
Vasishá¹­as to be allowed to ascend to heaven bodily, and who, by grace of
ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras, obtains instead the favour of remaining suspended in the

air
like a constellation, are also attributed to his son HariÃ§Äandras;
whence we may affirm, without much risk of contradiction, that as
TriÃ§aÃ±kus is another name for his son HariÃ§Äandras, so HariÃ§Äandras is
another name for his son Rohitas, and that, therefore, the TriÃ§aÃ±kus of
the

[226] that this cow of Vasishá¹­as, this
kÃ¢madhuk or kÃ¢madhenus, which yields at pleasure all that is wished for,
this cow of abundance, is kept by Vasishá¹­as, under the name of ÃabÃ¢lÃ¢,
as his own wife. ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras is covetous of her; he demands her from
Vasishá¹­as, and offers a hundred cows for her, the exact price which, in
the

[227] ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras carries her off; she
returns to the feet of Vasishá¹­as,

and
bellows; her bellowing calls forth armies, who come out of her own body;
the hundred sons of ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras are burned to ashes by them. These
armies which come out of the body of Vasishá¹­as's cow remind us again of
the Vedic cow, from which come forth winged darts, or birds, by which
the enemies are filled with terror. Vasishá¹­as is a form of Indras; his
cow is here the rain-cloud. ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras, who wishes to ravish the cow
from Vasishá¹­as, often assumes monstrous forms in the Hindoo legends, and
is almost always malignant, perverse, and revengeful. His hundred sons
burned to cinders by Vasishá¹­as remind us, from one point of view, of the
hundred cities of Ãambaras destroyed by Indras, and the hundred perverse
Dhá¹itarÃ¢shtrides of the

This story of the cow of Vasishá¹­as, whose relationship with the
legend of Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas cannot be doubted, brings us back to the animal
forms of heroes and heroines from which we started. In the story of
Vasishá¹­as, the cow-cloud, the cow Ã§abÃ¢lÃ¢, or the spotted-cow, plays in
the epic poem the part of the cow Aditis, the cow pá¹iÃ§nis (spotted,
variegated), with which we are already familiar in the Vedic hymns. This
cow is benignant towards the god, or the hero, or the wise Vasishá¹­as, as
the pá¹iÃ§nis is to the god Indras. But we have seen in the
á¹igvedas itself the cloud as the enemy of the god, and
represented as a female form of the monster, as his sister. This sister
generally tries to seduce the god, promising to deliver into his hands
the monster her brother, and she sometimes succeeds, as the witch
HidimbÃ¢ of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, who gives up her brother, the
monster Hidimbas, into the hands of the hero BhÃ®mas, who thereupon
espouses her. On the other hand, ÃÃ»rpaá¹akhÃ¢, the sister of the monster
RÃ¢vaá¹as, does not succeed in her intent; making herself beautiful, she
endeavours to win the affection of the hero RÃ¢mas; but being ridiculed
by him and by Lakshmaá¹as, she becomes deformed, and sends forth cries
like a cloud in the rainy season,[228] exciting her brothers to
annihilate RÃ¢mas. The same cloud-monster is found again in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am,
under the name of Dundubhis, in the form of a terrible buffalo with
sharpened horns.[229] The buffalo, as a wild animal, is
often chosen to represent the principle of evil, in the same way as the
bull, increaser of the bovine herds, is selected as the image of good. This bellowing buffalo, whence his name of Dundubhis (drum), strikes and
knocks with his two horns at the door of the cavern[230] of the son of Indras (BÃ¢lin), the
king of the monkeys. But BÃ¢lin takes Dundubhis by the horns, throws him
on the ground, and destroys him. [231] Indras, his enemy in the Vedas,
having fallen from heaven, he became one of

the
most popular gods, and even sometimes the most popular form of the
deity. In the

[232] In the

[233] the criminality of Indras in this
regard is confirmed, to which the

[234] and he cuts all the three heads
off together (

European
popular tales must cut off, at a blow, the three heads of the serpent,
the wizard, otherwise he is powerless, and able to do nothing. The
monster, like the hero, seems to have a special affinity for the number
three: hence the three heads of TriÃ§iras, as also the three brothers of
LaÃ±kÃ¢–RÃ¢vaá¹as, the eldest brother, who reigns; Kumbhakará¹as, the middle
brother, who sleeps; Vibhishaá¹as, the third brother, whom the two others
do not care about, but who alone is just and good, and who alone obtains
the gift of immortality. [235] We have evidently here again the
three Vedic brothers; the two eldest in demoniacal form, the youngest a
friend of the divine hero, and who, by the victory of RÃ¢mas over the
monster RÃ¢vaá¹as, obtains the kingdom of LaÃ±kÃ¢. As to the brothers RÃ¢mas
and Lakshmaá¹as, and the brothers BÃ¢lin and SugrÃ®vas, their natural place
is in the story of the two twins, which will be referred to in the next
chapter, although Hanumant, the son of the wind, figures second to them
in the character of strong brother. Tritas, in the same relationships to one another and with the same
natures; only the legend is amplified. [236] As to their other brothers, twins,
born of another mother, Nakulas and Sahadevas, they are the sons of the
two AÃ§vinÃ¢u, and feebly repeat in the

[237] BhÃ®mas, at one draught, drinks the
whole cisternful; and with similar expedition, he drains consecutively
eight cisterns. [238] The first-born of the PÃ¢ná¸avas is
dear to his father Yamas, the god of justice, DharmarÃ¢Çµas,–and is

himself
indeed called DharmarÃ¢Çµas; and when he prepares himself to ascend into
heaven, the god Yamas follows him in the form of a dog: by his skill in
solving enigmas, he saves his brother BhÃ®mas from the king of the
serpents. The third brother, ArÇµunas, son of Indras, is the Benjamin of
the Vedic supreme God. Indras welcomes him with festivals in heaven,
whither ArÇµunas had gone to find him. ArÇµunas is an infallible archer,
like Indras; like Indras, he several times regains the cows from the
robbers or from the enemies; and, like Indras, he wins and conquers his
bride; he is born by the assistance of all the celestials; he is
invincible (

[239] he alone of the three brothers has
compassion on his master Droá¹as and delivers him from an aquatic
monster. [240]

But there is yet another particular which shows the resemblance
between the three brothers PÃ¢á¹á¸avas and the three brothers of the Vedas;
it is their dwelling, hidden in the palace of the king VirÃ¢á¹­a, in the
fourth book of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam. They are exiled from the
kingdom, like RÃ¢mas; they flee from the persecution of their enemies,
now into the woods, now, as the á¹ibhavas, disguised as workmen in the
palace of VirÃ¢á¹­as, to whom their presence brings every kind of
happiness. [241] The first disciple, Upamanyus,
takes his master's cows out to pasture, and, out of sensitive regard for
his master's interest, refuses to drink not only their milk, but even
the foam from their mouths, and fasts till, like to perish of hunger, he
bites a leaf of arkapatrÃ¢ (properly, leaf of the sun, the

when
he instantly becomes blind. He wanders about and falls into a well; he
there sings a hymn to the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, and they come immediately to deliver
him. The second brother, UddÃ¢lakas, places his body, as a dike, to
arrest the course of the waters. The third brother is Vedas, he who
sees, he who knows, whose disciple UtaÃ±kas is himself in the form of a
hero. UtaÃ±kas, like the Vedic Tritas, and the PÃ¢á¹á¸avas ArÇµuá¹as, is
protected by Indras. He is sent by the wife of his master to abstract
the earrings of the wife of King PÃ¢ushyas. He sets out; on his way he
meets a gigantic bull, and a horseman, who bids him, if he would
succeed, eat the excrement of the bull; he does so, rinsing his mouth
afterwards. He then presents himself to King PÃ¢ushyas and informs him of
his message; the king consigns the earrings to him, but cautions him to
beware of Takshakas, the king of the serpents. UtaÃ±kas says that he is
not afraid of him, and sets out with the earrings; but as he puts down
the earrings upon the shore, in order to bathe, Takshakas presents
himself in the shape of a naked mendicant, whips them up, and flees away
with them. UtaÃ±kas follows him, but Takshakas resumes his serpent form,
penetrates the ground, and descends under it; UtaÃ±kas attempts to follow
the serpent, but does not succeed in cleaving the entrance, which
corresponds to the Vedic rock under which the monster keeps his prey. Indras sees him tiring himself in vain, and sends his weapon, in order
that it may be for a help to UtaÃ±kas; that weapon, or club, penetrating,
opened the cavern. [242] This club, this weapon of Indras
is evidently the thunderbolt. [243] UtaÃ±kas

descends
into the kingdom of the serpents, full of infinite wonders. Indras
reappears at his side in the shape of a horse,

[244] and obliges the king, Takshakas,
to give back the earrings; having taken which, UtaÃ±kas mounts the horse,
that he may be carried more swiftly to the wife of his master, from whom
he learns that the horseman seen by him on the way was none other than
Indras himself; his horse, Agnis, the god of fire; the bull, the steed
of Indras, or the elephant Ãiravatas; the excrement of the bull, the
ambrosia, which made him immortal in the kingdom of the serpents. In
another episode of the same (the first) book of the

[245] we again find Indras busied in the
search of the earrings, that is to say, of the excessively fleshy part
hanging from the ears of Kará¹as, the child of the sun, who, as soon as
born, had been abandoned upon the waters. We have seen above how the two
AÃ§vinÃ¢u are also represented in the

[246]

In the
commentary of

[247] a BrÃ¢hman who falls under the
power of a forest monster who leaps on his shoulders, frees himself by
asking why his feet are so soft. The monster confesses that it is
because, on account of a vow, he cannot touch the earth with his feet. The BrÃ¢hman then betakes himself to a sacred pond; the monster wishes to
take a bath, and the BrÃ¢hman throws him in; the monster orders him to
stay there till he has bathed and said his orisons. The BrÃ¢hman profits
by this opportunity to make his escape, knowing that the monster will
not be able to overtake him, as he cannot put his feet to the ground. It
is the usual vulnerability, weakness, or imperfection of the hero, or
the monster, in the feet, and, if an animal is spoken of, in the
tail. [248]

The

[249] the two rival sisters of the
Vedas, the good and the evil. In the

[250] the witch ÃÃ»rpanakhÃ¢, who seduces
RÃ¢mas, in order to take the place of SÃ®tÃ¢ at his side, is compared to
Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢, who seduced NÃ¢hushas. In the

[251] The prince takes her by the right
hand and draws her up; and because in the marriage ceremony, the bride
is taken by the right hand,

[252] the prince YayÃ¢tis is said to
marry DevayÃ¢nÃ®. But even after she is a wife, Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢ continues to
seduce her husband, to whom she unites herself. Two sons are born of
DevayÃ¢nÃ®, Yadus and Turvasas, similar to Indras and Vishá¹us (a new form
of the twins, of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u); three are born of Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢, Duhyus,
Anus, and PÃ»rus; and here also the third brother is the most glorious
and valiant. And in this way the episode is connected with the essential
legend of the

assumed
by the same hero. Each day gave birth in the heavens to a new hero and a
new monster, who exterminate each other, and afterwards revive in an
aspect more or less glorious, according as their names were more or less
fortunate. It is for the same reason that the sons always recognise their
fathers without having once seen them or even heard them spoken of; they
recognise themselves in their fathers. Thus ÃakuntalÃ¢ and UrvacÃ® enable
their mother to find again the husband that she has lost, and their
father to recover his lost wife. Thus in the episode of DevayÃ¢nÃ® and
Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢, when the former wishes to know who is the father of the
three sons of Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢, so similar to the sons of immortals, she turns
to them, and they tell her at once. For this fault, YayÃ¢tis, from being young, is fated to become old. He
then beseeches the two eldest of the three sons that he had by
Ãarmishá¹­hÃ¢ to take on themselves the old age of their father; they
refuse, but the third son, PÃ»rus, out of reverence for his father,
consents to become old in his stead, to give up his youth to his father. After a thousand years, the king YayÃ¢tis, satiated with life, restores
to his son PÃ»rus his youth, and although he is the youngest, along with
his youth, the kingdom, because he found him the only one of the three
who respected the paternal will; and he expels the two eldest
brothers.[253]

Sometimes, however, the blind old father is entirely abandoned by his
sons. Thus the old DÃ®rghatamas (of the vast darkness), blind from birth,
is deprived of food, and thrown into the water by his wife and
sons,[254] but a heroic king saves him, in
order, by his wife, to beget sons for him. We have in DÃ®rghatamas and YayÃ¢tis, King Lear in embryo. In the same legend of DÃ®rghatamas, we find an exchange of wives. Queen SudeshnÃ¢, instead of going herself, sends her servant-maid, her
foster-sister, to be embraced by DÃ®rghatamas.[255] In the cunning SudeshnÃ¢ we have an
ancient variation of Queen Berta. [256] who appear in the

know from the

princess. The blind recovers sight by the steam of the poison of a black serpent,
cooked in milk (the darkness of night, or of winter, mixed with the
clearness of day, or of the snow); he then, being a strongly-built man,
takes the hunchback by the legs, and beats his hunch against the third
and superfluous breast of the princess. The anterior prominence of the
latter, and the posterior one of the former, enter into their respective
bodies;

[260] thus the blind, the crooked, and
the three-breasted princess help and cure each other; the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u
and the aurora (or the spring) reappear together in beauty. The AÃ§vinÃ¢u
and the aurora also come forth together from the monstrous shades of
night; the AÃ§vinÃ¢u contend for the aurora; as we shall see soon, and in
the next chapter, the delivered bride disputed for by the brothers. [261] in the legend of the loves of the
virgin TapatÃ®, daughter of the sun (the luminous and burning aurora, and
also the summer season, ardent as DahanÃ¢), with the king Saá¹varaá¹as, son
of the bear (

own; she answers not a word, but flees and disappears like the lightning
in the clouds;

[262] the king cannot overtake her,
because his horse, while he was hunting, has died of hunger and thirst;
he searches in vain through the forest, but not seeing her, he throws
himself almost breathless to the ground. As he lies there the beautiful
girl appears again, approaches and wakens him; he again speaks to her of
love, and she answers that he must ask her father the sun, and then,
still quite innocent, she disappears swiftly on high (

[264] Besides milk and ambrosia, she
yields herbs and gems, which we have already referred to, as analogous
products

mythology. The cow of Vasishá¹­has is, besides her tail, celebrated for
her breasts, her horns, and even her ears ending in a point; whence her
name of

Vasishá¹­has cannot endure the pain this causes him: he tries to throw
himself down from the summit of Mount Merus, but he falls without
hurting himself; he throws himself into the fire, but does not burn
himself; and, finally, he leaps into the sea, but is not drowned. These
three miracles are accomplished every day by the solar hero, who throws
himself down from the mountain into the gloomy ocean of night, after
having passed through the burning sky of evening. Vasishá¹­has ends by freeing, with the help of charmed water, the
monster ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras from his curse; and the latter is no sooner
delivered from the demon who possessed him, than he begins again to
illumine the forest with his splendour, as the sun illumines a twilight
cloud. The friendships, enmities, and rivalries of Vasishá¹­has and
ViÃ§vÃ¢mitras seem to be another version of those of the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u, whom
we shall particularly describe in the next chapter. it is
better to stop short, lest, by expatiating further, we should lose sight
of the essential aim of our work, and be tempted into digressions from
the legends relating to beasts to those relating to men; besides, we
think that we have sufficiently proved the thesis of this chapter, and
shown how the principal mythical subjects of the Vedic hymns are not
only preserved, but developed, in the posterior Hindoo traditions. It is
not entirely our fault if, from cows, we pass so often to princesses,
and from bulls to princes; the myth itself involves and indicates these
transformations. Hence we find the bull Indras, the winner of the cows,
become a winner and a seducer of women; we see the bull Wind, who aids
Indras in the conquest of the cows, become the violator of a hundred
damsels;

[265] we read of the bull and god
Rudras, as husband of UmÃ¢, given up to sensual indulgence for a hundred
years without a pause; that the son of the bull, or of the wind,
Hanumant, does prodigies of valour and strength for the sake of a
beautiful woman, and receives, as a reward for his zeal, from the king
Bharatas, a hundred thousand cows, sixteen wives, and a hundred
servant-maids. [266] What could Hanumant have done with
so many wives and maids, if he were simply a bull? or what could he have
done with so many cows, if he had been an ape? It is these
inconsistencies which have caused mythology to be condemned by the crowd
of old but prolific pedants, as a vain science; whereas, on the
contrary, it is precisely these inconsistencies which raise it, in our
esteem, to the rank of a valid science. He who
handed down to us the feats of Hanumant, took care also to tell us how
he had the faculty of changing his form at will; and this faculty,
attributed to this impersonation of a celestial phenomenon, is the fruit
of one of the most

on the other the Turanian traditions. We cannot pass into Europe without
at least indicating the general character of each. In the Persian cosmogony, the bull (gÃ¢us aevo dÃ¢to) is one
of the first of created existences, being as old as the elements. It is,
moreover, well known how much importance was ascribed to the bull among
the Persians in the mysteries of the solar god Mithra, who is
represented as a beautiful youth, holding the horns of a bull in his
left hand, and having the knife of sacrifice in his right. Mithra
sacrificing the bull is just the solar hero sacrificing himself in the
evening. Indeed, in the Persian tradition, Mithra, like the Hindoo
Yamas, holds the office of god of the dead, and as such, like Yamas, is
of a monstrous aspect, and is found in the YaÃ§na represented
with a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes. As in India, so in Persia, the urine of the cow is used in ceremonies
of purification, during which it is drunk.[267] We have already seen in the story
of UtaÃ±kas how the excrement of the bull, upon which UtaÃ±kas fed, was
ambrosia itself; and, indeed, all is beneficial which is given by the
cow of abundance (the moon, the cloud, and the aurora), and by the
divine bull (the moon and the sun). The mythical belief was natural,
however disgusting when we insist on literal interpretation. And even in the Persian tradition itself, a distinction already
exists between common bulls or oxen and sacred or privileged ones. This
distinction appears in the legend of Gemshid, whose bulls were all
devoured by the devil, as long as they were protected by no magical
rites; whilst, when he was given a red ox (or bull) cooked in old, that
is strong, vinegar, to which was added garlic and rue (famous for its
potency in exorcism), he disappeared and was never seen again.[268] The rue is probably the fabulous
plant which the Zend tradition surmises to have sprung from the sea
VÃ´uru-Kasha, whence Ahura Mazda draws the clouds, from which
all healthful water is derived, and which corresponds to the sea of milk
of Hindoo tradition, in which the ambrosia is agitated. Thus the funereal cypress of Kishmar (planted by Zarathustra, with a
branch from the tree of Paradise), under which more than two thousand
cows and sheep could pasture, and the innumerable birds of which
darkened the air, obscuring the light of the sun, reminds us of the
celestial forest of the VedÃ¢s, in which the shepherd-hero and the
hunter-hero wander and are lost. The idea of the funereal tree recalls to us that of the Persian
mountain ArezÃ»ra or DemÃ¢vend, where the demons met together to plot
evil, and where was the gate of hell.[269]

The Zend word aÃ§ma, which signifies stone and heaven, yields
us, in its double meaning, the key to the interpretation of the myth. This stone, inasmuch as it is dark, is of evil omen; inasmuch as it
shines, it is a gem, or gives the gem (the moon or the sun); whence,
according to the Minokhired, the sky is the progeny of a
precious stone.[270]

Thus to the mountain of the demons (where the sun goes down), is
opposed in Persian tradition the glorious mountain, out of which are
born the heroes and the kings (or
from which the sun rises and the moon); because Haoma is born there (the
Hindoo Somas), the ambrosial, golden, and health-bringing god, who gives
them the divine nourishment, and because the sacred bird, which stays on
that mountain, feeds them with ambrosia, whence the YaÃ§na[271] invites Haoma to grow on the road
of the birds. [272] Zarathustra is himself also born
upon a mountain;

[273] while his son ÃaoshyaÅÃ§, the
deliverer, comes out of the waters. [274] the conductor of the souls across
the bridge Äinvat, created by Ahura Mazda, to the kingdom of the
blessed. The cow, as the guide of the souls

[275] lost in the kingdom of the dead,
and placed upon the bridge, is probably the moon; the bitch (also the
moon) reminds us of the Hindoo SaramÃ¢, the bitch which aids the heroes

who
have lost themselves in the nocturnal forest, grotto, or darkness. In
the same chapter, after accounts of the bridge, we read the praise of
the good Ãaoka, who has many eyes (like the brÃ¢hmanic Indras, disguised
as a woman, having a thousand eyes, and, after the adventure of AhalyÃ¢,
a thousand wombs–the god hidden in the night, who looks at the world
through a thousand stars); after Ãaoka, of the splendid Veretraghna (who
corresponds to Vá¹itrahan, properly the discomfiter of the all-covering
darkness); and after him, of the luminous star Tistar, which seems a
bull with golden hoofs,

[276] which again must refer to the
moon; as the GÃ¢hs, who, according to Anquetil, "sont occupÃ©es Ã  filer
des robes pour les justes dans le ciel," like the cows and Madonnas in
our popular tales, cannot be very different from the fairy, or at least
from the stars which form her crown. The

body
also is invoked in the

[277] The Geusurva appears in the

[278] as the protectress of the
fourteenth day of the month, or of the full-moon, viewed as a full cow. And when it is said in the

[279] that one must not sacrifice to the
Geusurva at the time when the Daevas, or demons, are practising their
evil-doings, it seems to me to indicate clearly enough that the
sacrifice was to take place while the moon was increasing, and not while
it was diminishing. Thus Asha Vahista, who reminds us of the Hindoo
Vasishá¹­has and his marvellous cow, has the power of conjuring away
illness, north winds–in a word, evil of every kind–only when
AgÌro-maiá¹yus appears without help. [280]

[281] has preserved the formula to be
recited by the devotee, whilst he holds in his hands the urine of an ox
or cow, preparatory to washing his face with it:–"Destroyed, destroyed
be the demon Ahriman, whose actions and works are cursed. His actions
and works do not come to us. May the thirty-three Amshaspands (the
immortal saints, who correspond to the thirty-three Vedic devÃ¢s), and
Ormazd,

be
victorious and pure!" It is said this remedial formula was used for the
first time by Yima, when, from having touched Ahriman, in order to
extricate from his body, by fraud, Takh mo Urupa, whom the demon had
devoured, he had an eruption on his hand. Finally, it is interesting to
learn that one of the Zend names of the moon is

[282] even in the version of
Professor

Spiegel, who perhaps would have introduced some little variation if he
had recognised the aurora in ArdvÃ® ÃÃ»ra AnÃ¢hita. In this hymn, the
victorious and mighty Thraetaona, in the form of a bird, flies for three
days and three nights, which reminds us of the fugitive Indras of the

[283] and we are recommended to offer up
sacrifices to her at break of day, before

the
sun rises. [284] We have seen the Vedic aurora and
the sun propose and solve riddles; we have seen the Hindoo solar hero
free himself from the monster by proposing or solving insoluble enigmas;
in the same way, in the

[285] The fact of finding the AnÃ¢hita
drawn by four white horses, like the sun Mithra, enhances the evidence
of this identity. And if the aurora is not explicitly represented in the

But
Mithra is not a god of mere idyllic exploits, he is also a hero; the

[286] salutes him as "the most
victorious of the victors." The booty of his victory [essentially due to
his immediate predecessors Veretraghna (Vá¹itrahan) and Ãraosha]

[287] must have been the cows of the
aurora, without which his immense pasture-lands would have been of no
use to him. Indeed it is said that Mithra enables owners of herds to
recover their lost oxen. [288]

[289] As the bull Indras assists Tritas,
TrÃ¢itanas, and Kavya UÄanas

[290] in the

[291] who is rich, splendid, and strong,
and who, like Indras, cures maladies by the help of the guardian of the
metals (the usual co-relation between the hero and the magic pearl),
assists Thraetaona, the killer of the serpent DuhÃ¢ka (Azhi DahÃ¢ka)

and
the hero Kava UÃ§a, of which Kava HaoÃ§rava is another name rather than
another form. The Thrita and Thraetaona of the

[292] we find three men who, by their
piety, win the favour of the god Haoma (Soma, the lunar god, the moon,
the good magician, the good fairy). The first

is
VivaghÃ¢o, the second Ãthvya, and the third Thrita; from which we are led
to conclude that VivaghÃ¢o is the eldest brother, Ãthvya the second, and
Thrita the youngest. On account of their piety, they obtain sons; the
son of VivaghÃ¢o is Yima (the Vedic Yamas), the wise, the happy, the
heavenly; the son of Ãthvya is Thraetaona, the warrior who discomfits
the monster; the third, Thrita, called the most useful, has two sons,
UrvÃ¢ksha and KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa, who remind us of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u. Ãthvya's son and
Thrita being confounded in one person, Thraetaona, or Thrita, forms a
new triumvirate with UrvÃ¢ksha and KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa, as the Vedic Indras with
the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u. The story of the three brothers and that of the two
brothers seem to be interwoven even in the myth, as they certainly are
afterwards in the legend. To the three brothers, moreover, correspond,
in the

[293] The first seems to correspond to
Yamas, the second to Ãptya and his son Thraetaona (or Thrita), the
third, the luminous, the beautiful (as being the aurora), to the two
handsome brother horsemen, UrvÃ¢ksha and KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u). the

[294]

[295] the same rivalry between the wind
(vÃ¢ta) and the son of Thrita, the hero KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa. An evil genie informs
the wind that KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa boasts of being superior to him in strength. Thereupon the wind begins to howl and rage in such a terrifying manner
that nothing can resist him, and the very trees are cleft in two or torn
up, till KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa comes and squeezes him so tightly in his arms that he
is obliged to cease. This interesting mythical incident is a
prefigurement of the loud whistle of the heroes and the monsters in
fairy tales, which is brought to an end in a summary fashion, similar to
that of the Persian legend; which also leads us to suppose that
Thraetaona vanquished the serpent DahÃ¢ka, merely by tying him to the
demoniacal mountain DemÃ¢vend. [296] This style of vanquishing the
enemy by binding him occurs often enough in the Persian

legends
and in the

[297] and is also mentioned in the
Hindoo traditions. The arrows of the monsters hurled against the heroes
of the

The bow of Mithra is formed of a thousand bows, prepared from the
tough hide of a cow; these bows, in the Avesta, also hurl a
thousand darts, which fly with winged vultures' feathers.[298] This carries us back again to the
Vedic myth of the birds which come out of the cow. The bow being considered a cow, this cow sharpens its horns; whence
the Khorda Avesta celebrates the horned darts of the bow of
Mithra, i.e., the horns of the cow, which have become
weapons[299] or the thunderbolts. there
are two heroes, celebrated in the

[300]) and KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa (he of the lean
horse), it is the second who is the glorious hero; as in the Russian
popular tales, we shall find the third brother, though thought to be an
idiot, despised by the others, and riding the worst jade of the stable,
yet becoming afterwards the most fortunate hero. KereÃ§Ã¢Ã§pa avenges his
brother UrvÃ¢ksha against HitÃ¢Ã§pa, whom Professor Spiegel

[301] interprets to mean the bound
horse, but which can also be rendered he who keeps the horse bound,
which would bring us back again to the story of the bridle and of the
hero-horse, whom the demon keeps bound to himself, which we have already
noticed above in the story of the sacrifice of Ãunaá¸¥Ã§epas, delivered by
the aurora. the
son of the watery one, Thraetaona, in the

[302] in order that she may help him to
vanquish the three-headed monster-serpent DahÃ¢ka. Now, Thraetaona, the
victorious and rich in oxen,

[303] being a well-known form of the
solar hero Mithra, it is interesting to learn how the heroine, the
so-called Ashis VagÌuhi (the aurora, or the moon, as the three words
ArdvÃ® ÃÃ»ra AnÃ¢hita are simple names of the aurora), having the same
supreme god for her father, has three brothers, of whom the first is
Ãraosha, the pious; the second, Rashnus, the strong; and the third,
Mithra, the victorious. She is, moreover, herself represented as being pursued by enemies on
horseback; and it is now a bull, now a sheep, now a child, anon a virgin
who hides her from her pursuers. Not knowing where to go, whether to
ascend into heaven, or creep along the earth, she applies to Ahura
Mazda, who answers that she must neither ascend into heaven nor creep
along the earth, but betake herself to the middle of a beautiful king's
habitation.[304] How is it possible not to
recognise in her the moon, or the aurora, who follows the path of the
sun her husband, the moon, or the aurora, who appears on the summit of
the high mountains? Other facts not devoid of mythological interest might perhaps be
found in the Avesta, which, on account of the uncertainty
attending the translation of the original texts, has hitherto been, it
seems to me, utterly neglected by mythologists. And yet, though
Anquetil, Burnouf, Benfey, Spiegel, Haugh, Kossowicz, and all who have
turned their talents and science to the interpretation of the Zendic
texts, disagree in the more abstruse passages, there are many of which
the interpretation is certain, in which the learned translators agree,
which offer interesting mythological data, and permit us, in any case,
to extract from the Avesta an embryo of mythology, in the same
way as an embryo of grammar has already been extracted from it. The
brief references which I have now made to the myth of the cow and the
bull in the Avesta, anyhow appear to me sufficient to warrant
the conclusion I draw, that the cow and the bull presented the same
aspects, and generated the same myths and the same beliefs in Persia as
in India, albeit in a form far more feeble and indeterminate. The solar hero of Persia occurs again in the costume of historical
legend in the Cyrus (ÎÏÏÎ¿Ï) of Herodotus and Ktesias, the first of which
represents to us the child exposed by his parents, saved and educated
during his infancy (like the Hindoo Kará¹as, child of the sun, and
Ká¹ishá¹as) among the shepherds, where for some time he gives
extraordinary proofs of his valour; the second shows us the young hero
who wins his own bride, Amytis, daughter of Astyages. Finally, the same hero appears in several splendid and glorious forms
in the Shahname. As in the á¹igvedas, Tritas or TrÃ¢itanas, and in the
Avesta, Thraetaona (of whom Thritas is a corresponding form),
accomplish the great exploit of killing the monster, and more especially
the serpent, so Feridun, the Persian synonym (by means of the
intermediate form Phreduna) for
the Zendic Thraetaona is, in subsequent Persian tradition, the most
distinguished hero in the struggle against the monster. I shall not
insist upon the deeds of Feridun and his mythical valour, after the
learned paper written upon the subject by Professor R. Roth, which
appears in the Transactions of the Oriental Society of Leipzig, and the
able and highly-valued essay by Professor Michael BrÃ©al on the myth of
Hercules and Cacus. I shall therefore content myself with quoting from
the legend of Feridun the episode of his old age, which reminds us of
the Vedic myth of the three brothers. The great king Feridun has three sons, Selm, TÃ»r, and IreÇµ (Selm,
TÃ»r, and Er are also the sons of Thraetaona); he divides the world into
three parts and gives the west to the first-born, and the north to the
second, whilst he keeps Iran for the youngest. The two eldest are
jealous, and announce to their father their intention of declaring war
against him, unless he expels their younger brother IreÇµ from the
palace. Feridun replies to their impious threat with haughty reproofs,
and meanwhile warns the young IreÇµ of the danger he is in. The youth
proposes to go in person to his brothers, and induce them to make peace;
his father is unwilling to let him go, but finally consents, and gives
him a letter for the two brothers, in which he commends him as his
best-loved son to their care. IreÇµ arrives at his brothers' dwelling;
their soldiers see him, and cannot take their eyes off him, as though
they already recognised him for their lord. Then Selm, the eldest,
advises TÃ»r, the second, the strong one, to kill IreÇµ; TÃ»r thereupon
assaults the defenceless IreÇµ, and transfixes his breast with a dagger. IreÇµ is afterwards avenged by the son of his daughter (born after his
death of a maid whom he had
left pregnant), the hero MinuÄehr, who kills Selm and TÃ»r. The hero who succeeds MinuÄehr is Sal, the son of Sam, whom, because
born with white hair, his father had exposed upon Mount Alburs, where
the bird Simurg nourished and saved him. Sal proves his wisdom before
MinuÄehr by solving six astronomical riddles which King MinuÄehr
proposes to him. The king, satisfied, orders him to be dressed in
festive clothes; he then, to prove his strength, challenges him to run a
tilt with the horsemen; Sal is victorious, and obtains another robe of
honour and innumerable royal gifts; after which he espouses Rudabe,
daughter of King Mihrab. [305] or a horned mace (the hero is the
bull, the thunderbolts are his horns), and whose horse is so powerful as
by itself to fight and vanquish a lion while Rustem is asleep. The hero
himself kills a dragon, and a witch transformed into a beautiful woman,
but who resumes her monstrous shape as soon as the hero pronounces the
name of a god. He thunders like a cloud, is dark, and describes himself
as a thunder-cloud which hurls the thunderbolt. [306] He binds the warrior Aulad, and
obliges him to reveal where the demons detain in prison King Kawus, who
is become blind in their kingdom of darkness. Kawus then informs Rustem
that to recover his sight his eyes must be anointed

with
three drops of blood from the slain demon Sefid; upon which Rustem sets
out to kill the demon. The demons can be vanquished only by day; when it
is light, they sleep, and then they can be conquered, says Aulad to
Rustem; for this reason, Rustem does not begin the enterprise till the
sun is in mid-heaven;

[307] then he thunders and lightens at
the demons. Like a sun, he sets out towards the mountain (no doubt,
towards sunset), where the demon Sefid sits, and arrives at the mouth of
a deep and gloomy cavern, from which Sefid sallies forth in the form of
a black giant just awakened from his sleep. The giant himself, like an
enormous mountain assaulting the earth, hurls a rock like a millstone at
Rustem; Rustem strikes the monster on the feet, and lops away one of
them; the lame giant continuing the fight, Rustem at last wrestles with
him, lifts him into the air, then beats him several times furiously
against the ground, and so takes his life. He throws the body of Sefid
into the mountain cavern, whilst his blood saturates the earth, and
gives back to the prince Kawus his eyesight and his splendour. The myth
is a beautiful and an expressive one. As from the black venomous serpent
comes white healthy milk, so from the black monster, at his death, comes
blood, which gives back his eyesight to the blinded prince; the red
aurora is here represented as the blood of the nocturnal monster,
discomfited by the solar hero. Let me ask the reader to notice the Persian comparison of the rock
thrown by the demon to a millstone, as it is important to explain a
superstition still extant in the
West, to the effect that the devil goes under the millstone to carry out
his evil designs. The stone or mountain fractured by the waters was
naturally compared to a millstone moved by the waters; the demons
inhabit the cavernous mountain to guard the waters; thus the devil, the
evil one, the hobgoblins, prefer mills as their dwellings. Rustem fights, in the Shahname, many other victoriously
successful battles against Afrasiab the Turanian, and other demoniacal
beings, in the service of sundry heroic kings, with epic incidents to
boot, which are nearly all uniform. His struggle against his son Sohrab,
however, is of an entirely different character. Rustem goes to the chase. In the forest, Turkish bandits rob him of
his invaluable horse while he sleeps; he then sets out, alone and sad,
towards the city of Semengam, following the track left by his horse. When he appears, emerging from the wood, the king of Semengam and his
courtiers note the phenomenon as though it were the sun coming out of
the clouds of morning.[308] The king receives Rustem with
great hospitality, and, as if to fill to the full the measure of his
courtesy, he sends at night to the room where he sleeps his exceedingly
beautiful daughter Tehmime. The hero and the beauty separate in the
morning; but Rustem, before parting from Tehmime, leaves her a pearl of
recognition. If a daughter is born to their loves, she is to wear it as
an amulet in her hair; if a son, he is to wear it on his arm, and he
will become an invincible hero. After nine months, Tehmime gives birth
to Sohrab; at the age of one month he seems a year old, at three years
of age he amuses himself with
arms, at five he gives proof of a lion's courage, and at ten he
vanquishes all his companions, and asks his mother to inform him of his
father, threatening to kill her if she does not tell him. Scarcely does
Sohrab learn that he is the son of Rustem, than he conceives the desire
of becoming king of Iran and supplanting Kawus; he then commences his
persecution of the Iranian heroes by assaulting the white castle (the
white morning sky, the alba), defended by a beautiful warrior princess,
Gurdaferid, dear to the Iranian warriors. Sohrab conquers and destroys
the white castle, but in the moment of triumph, the warrior maiden
disappears. The old hero Rustem then moves against his own son Sohrab;
the latter throws him down, but Rustem, in his turn, mortally wounds
Sohrab. In the old Rustem thrown down on the mountain it is not
difficult to recognise the setting sun; in Sohrab mortally wounded by
Rustem, the sun itself, which dies; and in fact, the dying sun has a
different appearance from the new sun which rises and triumphs in the
heavens: these two appearances might give rise to the idea of a struggle
between the old and the young sun, in which both are sacrificed. Indeed,
Rustem feels, when he mortally wounds Sohrab, that he is wounding
himself; he curses his work and immediately sends for a healing balsam;
but in the meantime Sohrab dies. The only one who could destroy the
young sun was the old sun; the sun grows old and dies; Rustem alone
could kill Sohrab. With the death of Sohrab the glory of Rustem is also
eclipsed; he retires unto solitude, and the most grandiose period of his
epic life comes to an end. After this he only reappears in episodic
battles or enterprises; as, for instance, in his setting fire to Turan,
in which he resembles Hanumant, burner of LaÃ±kÃ¢; in the liberation of
the young hero Bishen, who had been
taken prisoner and incarcerated by the Turanians; in the killing of the
powerful and perverse Turanian Afrasiab; and in his own death in an
ambuscade set by young rivals of the old lion, who dies taking vengeance
on his enemies. In the very palace of Kawus (he who was protected by Rustem), a
notable legendary drama takes place. Sijavush, son of King Kawus, is
seduced by the queen-mother Sudabe, who burns with love for him. The
youth spurns this love, upon which she accuses him to King Kawus as her
seducer. The father, after hearing his son's defence in proof of his
innocence, cannot believe the queen; and thereupon she devises another
method for destroying the young Sijavush. She concerts with a slave she
has, who is a sorceress, and persuades her to create two little venomous
monsters, which she straightway proclaims aloud are the children of
Sijavush. Then Sijavush, to prove his innocence, submits willingly to
the trial by fire; he enters the flames upon his black horse, after
having embraced his trembling father; both horse and horseman come out
of the immense fire, amid the plaudits of all the spectators. Then the
king gives orders to strangle the unnatural queen; but his son Sijavush
intercedes in her favour, and Sudabe is allowed to live by grace of the
young prince, whom, however, she continues to persecute, till, on the
death of Sijavush, Rustem, who bewailed him as his own son, or as his
other self, avenges him first by killing Sudabe, on account of whom
Sijavush had been obliged to repair to Turan, and afterwards by carrying
the war into Turan, where, after a very agitated life, Sijavush had
fallen into the power of his father-in-law, Afrasiab, and been put to
death. The wife of Sijavush, Ferengis by name, being pregnant, is
hospitably entertained by Piran, and gives birth to the hero Kai Khosru;
and no sooner is he born than he is consigned to the shepherds of the
mountain. As early as seven years of age, his favourite amusement is
that of drawing the bow; at ten, he confronts wild boars, bears, lions,
and tigers with only his shepherd's staff. When Afrasiab sees the young
shepherd, he inquires at him about his sheep and the peaceful pursuits
of shepherds; the boy replies with stories of lions having sharp teeth,
and of other wild animals, of which he is not afraid. As soon as he
comes to manhood, he flees from Turan, followed by the Turanians; he
arrives at the banks of a river, where the ferryman asks impossible
conditions to take him over; upon which, like Feriá¸un, he crosses the
river safely, but without a boat, and on dry feet (it is the sun
traversing the cloudy and gloomy ocean without wetting himself);[309] arrived at length in Iran, he is
feasted and fÃªted as the future king. His reign begins; he then assigns
different tasks to different heroes, among whom is his brother Firud,
born of another mother, of whom it is said that a single hair of his
head has more strength in it than many warriors (one ray of the sun is
enough to break the darkness). One evening, however, at sunset, Firud is
killed in his castle upon the mountain, being surrounded by a crowd of
enemies, after having lost his horse, and after his mother Cerire had
dreamt that a fire had consumed both mountain and castle. His mother
Cerire (the evening aurora) throws herself among the flames with her
maids, and dies also. Kai Khosru bewails the loss of his brother Firud
all the night through, till
the cock crows; when morning comes he thinks of avenging him. After this, the life of Kai Khosru is consumed in battles fought by
his heroes against the Turanians. Only towards the end of his days does
he become a penitent king; he will no longer allow his subjects to
fight, and his only occupation is prayer; he takes leave of his people
and his daughters in peace, ascends a mountain, and disappears in a
tempest, leaving no trace of himself. In a similar manner the heroes
Yudhishá¹­hiras, Cyrus, and Romulus disappear (not to speak of the
biblical Moses, still less of Christ, as we do not wish to complicate a
comparison of which the materials are already so extensive, by mixing up
the Aryan elements with those of Semitic origin; although the legends of
the serpent, of Noah, of Abraham and his regained wife, of Abraham and
his son Isaac, of Joseph and his brethren, of Joshua, of Job, and other
and more recent biblical heroes, by their mythical or astronomical
import, present numerous analogies with the Indo-European legends); in a
similar manner, the old sun, weary of reigning in the heavens and
fighting for his life, becomes invisible every evening on the
mountain-peaks. The Shahname contains numerous other legends besides those
which we have thus far briefly described; and one of the most notable
is, beyond a doubt, that of Isfendiar, who goes with his brother
Bishutem to deliver his two sisters, imprisoned in a fortress by the
Turanian king Ardshasp. The seven adventures of Isfendiar,
i.e., his meeting with the wolf, the lion, the dragon, the
witch (who makes herself beautiful, but who is no sooner bound with the
enchanted necklace of Isfendiar [the solar disc] than she becomes old
and ugly again), the gigantic bird, the tempest and the river, all of
which dangers he
victoriously overcomes, are reproductions, in an analogous form too, of
the seven adventures of Rustem. Finally, the legend of Iskander or Iskender (the name of Alexander of
Macedon), full of extraordinary adventures, became exceedingly popular
in Persia, and thence, no doubt, passed with all its charms into Europe. The audacity and good fortune, the glory and the power of the great
conqueror were the reasons why there grouped round his name so many
extraordinary stories, which wandered dispersedly through the world
without epic unity. To make up one glorious and never-to-be-forgotten
hero, were combined together the achievements of many anonymous or
nearly forgotten ones. The Persian Iskendername of NishÃ¢mi, is,
as its name denotes, entirely taken up with the celebration of the deeds
of the Macedonian hero, of which the most illustrious are the liberation
of the princess NushÃ¢be (taken prisoner by the Russians), and the voyage
in search of the fountain of life and immortality, which, however,
Iskander cannot find. From Persia the same legend afterwards passed,
with new disguises, into Egypt, Armenia, and Greece, whence it was
diffused during the middle ages over almost the whole of Western
Europe.[310]

[311] of the Persian

Mongol
history of

[312] the first being a paraphrase of
the Hindoo

We have seen in the Ãitareya BrahmÃ¢nam the father who
prepares to offer up his son, and in the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, the son
who forfeits youth that his father may live. In the
Tuti-Name,[313] the faithful Merdi GÃ¢nbÃ¢z prepares
to sacrifice his wife and sons, and afterwards himself, to prolong the
life of the king; but his devotion and fidelity being proved, he is
arrested by God before he can accomplish the cruel sacrifice, and
receives numberless benefits from the king. In the story of the goldsmith and the woodcutter, the
Tuti-Name[314] reproduces the two brothers or
friends, of whom one is wicked, rich, and avaricious, while the other is
defrauded of the money due to him, because, though, in reality
intelligent, he is supposed to be an idiot. The woodcutter avenges
himself upon the goldsmith by a plan which we shall find described in
the legend of the bear, and recovers, thanks to his craftiness, the gold
which his brother or friend had kept from him. In the interesting story of Merhuma,[315] we read of the wife who is
persecuted by the seducer her brother-in-law. To avenge her refusal, he
causes her to be stoned during the absence of his brother; being
innocent, she rises again from under the stones; being sheltered by a
Bedouin, a monster of a slave seduces her; being repulsed, he accuses
her of the death of the Bedouin's little
son, whom he had himself killed; the beautiful girl flees away; she
frees a youth who was condemned to death, and who in his turn seduces
her. She then embarks in a ship; while she is at sea all the sailors
become enamoured of her and wish to possess her; she invokes the god who
caused Pharaoh to be drowned and who saved Noah from the waters. The
waves begin to move; a thunderbolt descends and burns to ashes all who
are in the ship, with the exception of the beautiful girl, who lands
safe and sound upon the shore (it is the aurora coming out of the gloomy
ocean of night, and the monsters who persecute her are burned to ashes
by the thunderbolts and the sun's rays); she thence escapes into a
convent, in which she ministers to the unfortunate, cures the lame, and
gives eyesight to the blind. Among the latter is her persecutor, the
brother of her husband; she pardons him and gives him back his eyesight;
in the same way she cures all her other persecutors. It is scarcely
necessary for me to remind the reader how this oriental tale, which
developed itself from the myth of the persecuted and delivering aurora
which we have seen in the Vedic hymns, reappears in numerous very
popular western legends, of which Crescentia and GeneviÃ¨ve are the most
brilliant types. The aurora comes out of the gloomy ocean and is espoused by the sun;
these heavenly nuptials in proximity to the sea gave rise to the popular
tale[316] of the king who wishes the sea
with its pearls to be present at his nuptials; the pearls of the
bride-aurora are supposed to come out of the sea of night. The sea sends
as gifts to the king a casket of pearls, a chest of precious dresses,
a
horse that goes like the morning wind, and a chest full of gold. The wise aurora figures again in the story of the ingenious
princess[317] who discovers, by means of a
story-riddle, the robbers who, during the night, stole the precious gem
destined for the king. The aurora imparts splendour and eyesight to the blinded sun. The
story of the three-breasted princess who, while she meditates poisoning
the blind man, in order that she may enjoy unrestrained the affections
of her young and handsome lover, relents and gives him back his sight,
reappears in a rather incomplete form in the Tuti-Name.[318]

The girl who has been married to a monster, whom she flees from to
follow a handsome young lover, who, arriving at the banks of a river,
despoils her of her riches, leaves her naked and passes over to the
other side, after which she resigns herself to her fate and resolves to
return to her husband the monster,[319] represents the evening aurora, who
flees before the monster of night to follow her lover the sun, who, in
the morning, after adorning himself with her splendour, leaves her on
the shore of the gloomy ocean and runs away, the aurora being thereupon
obliged in the evening to re-unite herself to her husband the monster. It is interesting, moreover, as bearing upon our subject, to note the
expression of which the youth who flees with the beautiful woman makes
use to express his fear of discovery. He says that the monster-husband
will follow them, and that should he sit upon the horns of the bull (the
moon) he would be sure to recognise him. The
story of two young people fleeing upon a bull, and followed by the
monster, occurs again in the Russian popular tales. By the horns of the
bull, the youth means the most prominent and visible situation; and he
knows, moreover, that if the monster overtakes them, he will be sure to
demonstrate the truth of the brave proverb which advises us in arduous
undertakings to take the bull by the horns. It is also the aurora who is represented by the beautiful maiden[320] whom her father, mother, and
brother have, without each other's knowledge, severally affianced to
three youths of different professions. The three young men contend for
her person, but while the quarrel is undecided, the girl dies. The three
then go to visit her tomb; one discovers her body, the second finds that
there is still some life in her, and the third strikes her and raises
her up alive, upon which the quarrel is resumed. She flees from them,
and withdraws into another living tomb, a convent. In the most popular
form of this legend the three companions, or three brothers, fighting
for the bride, divide her; the aurora is torn into pieces as soon as the
sun, her true lover and rightful suitor, appears. [321] (the morning sun can distinguish
between light and darkness); the wise boy (the young sun) is the brother
of the wise girl (the young aurora). The flesh of a killed BrÃ¢hman is
turned into gold in another story of the

[322]

We
have seen that the aurora and the sun are mother and son, brother and
sister, or lover and mistress. The sun in the evening dies
ignominiously, is sacrificed and hanged upon a gibbet, and with himself
sacrifices his mother or his mistress. The legend is popular and ancient
which speaks of the robber son, when about to end his life upon a
gibbet,

[323] biting the nose off his mother,
who gave birth to him and brought him up badly. In the

[324] it is the young adulterer (and
robber too) who, condemned to death for his adultery, asks to see his
mistress once more before his death and kiss her, and who, as she does
so, gratifies his revenge by inflicting upon her a like indignity. It is
remarkable how, even in the Hindoo popular tale, the story of the
adulterer is confounded with that of a thief; the adulterer ends by
being thrown into the water (the sun and the aurora fall into the gloomy
ocean of night). In the next story it is the wicked husband who, travelling with his
rich wife for change of dwelling-place, despoils her of her clothes, and
then throws her into a well in order to ensure possession of her jewels
and wardrobe. These riches, however, do not last long; he becomes poor
and goes begging alms, dressed as a mendicant, until he finds his wife
again, who had been saved by divine intervention from the well, and
provided anew with clothes and jewels of equal gorgeousness. The husband
passes some time with his wife, and then sets out again on a voyage with
her; he arrives at the same well, and throws her in as before to enjoy
alone her stripped-off garnitures and riches. (The meaning of the myth
is evident; it is
the sun throwing the splendid aurora into the gloomy waters of the
night.)

A king becomes enamoured of the beauteous Mahrusa;[325] his councillors tear him from his
love, upon which he pines away in solitude and dies. The beautiful girl
unites herself to him in the grave (Romeo and Juliet, the evening aurora
and the sun die together). The story of the three brothers, the á¹ibhavas, occurs again in the
Tuti-Name,[326] with other particulars which we
already know. The first brother is the wise one; the second is a maker
of talismans (amongst other things he can make a horse which will run in
one day over a space of ground that would take other horses thirty); the
third and youngest brother is the victorious archer. They set out to
search for the beautiful maiden who has fled by night from the house of
her father. The first brother discovers, by his wisdom, that the maiden
was carried off by the fairies into an island-mountain which men cannot
reach. The second creates a wonderful animal upon which to traverse the
intervening waters (Christophoros or BhÃ®mas). Having arrived at the
island-mountain, the third and youngest brother fights the demon, the
lord of the fairies, vanquishes him, and frees the beautiful girl, who
thereupon is conducted back to her father. Then there arises the usual
quarrel between the three brothers as to who is to possess the
bride. In the VedÃ¢s, we have the sky and the moon represented as a cup. From
the little cup of abundance (the moon) it is easy to pass to the
miraculous little pipkin (the moon), in which the kind-hearted but poor
housekeeper of the PÃ¢á¹á¸avas, in the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, still finds
abundance of vegetables, after her powers of hospitality had
been exhausted on the god Ká¹ishá¹as disguised as a beggar–to the pipkin
from which can be taken whatever is wished for. In the
Tuti-Name,[327] a woodcutter finds ten magicians
round a pipkin, and eating out of it as much and whatever they want;
they are pleased with the woodcutter, and, at his request, give him the
pipkin. He invites his acquaintances to a banquet at his house, but not
able to contain himself for joy, he places the pipkin upon his head, and
begins to dance. The pipkin falls to the ground and is broken to pieces,
and with it his fortune vanishes (the story of Perrette). A variation of the small cup is the wooden porringer (the moon),
which two brothers (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u) dispute for, in the history of the king
of China,[328] and from which can be taken
whatever drink and food is wished for; as, in the same story, we find
the enchanted shoes which carry us in an instant wherever we wish to
go;–which brings us back to the fugitive Vedic aurora, the swiftest in
the race, and to the popular tales relating to Cinderella, who is
overtaken and found again by the prince only when she has lost her
enchanted slipper. With the porringer and the enchanted shoes we find,
in the popular tales, the little purse full of money which fills again
as fast as it is emptied (another form of the cup of abundance), and a
sword which, when unsheathed, causes a fine, rich, and great city to
arise in a desert, which city disappears when the sword is put back into
the sheath (the solar ray is the drawn sword, which makes the luminous
city of the rich aurora arise; scarcely does the sun's ray vanish, or
scarcely is the sword sheathed, than the marvellous city vanishes). The
rest of the story is also interesting,
because it applies to three men a double and well-known fable of the
animals which contend for the prey (as the three brothers contend for
the beautiful maiden whom they have found again). The animals cannot
divide it equally; they refer to the judgment of a man passing by; he
divides it so well that the animals are ever after grateful to him, and
help him in every danger. The story of the Tuti-Name touches
upon this form of the myth, but soon abandons it for another equally
zoological, and a more familiar one, that of the third who comes in
between two that quarrel, and enjoys the prey. The young adventurer
undertakes to put an end to the dispute of the two brothers as to the
division of the purse, the porringer, the sword and the wonderful shoes;
he does so by putting the shoes on his feet and fleeing away with the
other three articles contended for (the two brothers AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the two
twilights, contend for the moon and also for the aurora, as we shall see
better in the next chapter; the sun puts an end to their quarrel by
espousing her himself). We are already familiar with the Vedic á¹ibhavas who out of one cup
make four. Probably upon this legend depends that of the four brothers
of the Tuti-Name,[329] who, as they let each a pearl fall
from their forehead upon the ground, see four mines open, one of copper,
the second of silver, the third of gold (the third brother is here again
the favourite), the fourth only of iron. The gem appears to be the sun
itself. The four mines seem to me to represent respectively the coppery
sky in the evening, the silver sky in the moonlight night, the sky in
the morning, golden with the dawn, and the iron sky, the grey or azure,
of the day. The word nÃ®las in Sanskrit
means azure, as well as black, and between azure and black is grey, the
colour of iron. Of the three brothers, the most learned, he who solves the enigmas,
is often the eldest; and in the story of the Tuti-Name,[330] the eldest of the three brothers
explains why old men have white hair, saying that this whiteness is a
symbol of the clearness of their thoughts. Let us now pass to the Calmuc and Mongol stories of
Siddhi-kÃ»r, which, as we have said above, are also of Hindoo
origin. In the first story, the three companions, forming at first three
groups of two, have resolved into six. The night-time is divided into
three, into six, into seven (six, plus an extraordinary one,
born afterwards), into nine (three groups of three), into twelve (three
groups of four). Hence, near the monster with three, six, seven, nine,
or twelve heads, we find sometimes three, sometimes six, seven, nine,
twelve brother-heroes. The last head (or the last two, three, or four
heads) of the monster, the decisive one, is the most difficult, and even
dangerous, to cut off; the last of the brothers is he who, by cutting it
off, is victorious. In the first Calmuc story of Siddhi-kÃ»r,
six brothers or companions separate where six rivers take their rise,
and go in search of fortune. The first-born perishes; the second, by
means of his wisdom (he partakes of the wisdom of the first-born, with
whom he is grouped), discovers the place where the dead one is buried;
the third, the strong one, breaks the rock under which the eldest is
hidden; the fourth resuscitates him by means of a health-bringing drink,
as BhÃ®mas, the strong hero of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, arises again
when he
drinks the water of health and strength; the fifth brother creates a
bird, which the sixth colours; this bird flies to the bride of the
eldest brother, and brings her among his companions, who, finding her
exceedingly beautiful, become, one and all, enamoured of her; they fight
for her, and, that each may have a part, end by cutting her to pieces. We already know the mythical meaning of this legend. The third and fourth Calmuc tales introduce explicitly the bull and
the cow. In the third, a man who possesses but one cow unites himself to
her, in order to make her fruitful. Of this union a tailed monster is
born, having a man's body and a bull's head. The man-bull (Minotauros)
goes into the forest, where he finds three companions–one black, one
green, and one white–who accompany him. The man-bull overcomes the
enchantments of a dwarf witch; his three companions lower him into a
well and leave him there, but he escapes. He meets a beautiful maiden
drawing water, at whose every footstep a flower arises; he follows her,
and finally finds himself in heaven; he fights against the demons, in
favour of the gods, and dies in this enterprise. This story, of Hindoo
origin, where the bull and the cow take the place of the hero and the
maiden, appears to me to justify the amplitude of the comparisons. We have already seen the beneficial qualities of the excrement of the
cow. In the fourth story, it is under the excrement of a cow that the
enchanted gem, lost by the daughter of the king, is found. It is of the
cow that the pearl is the secretion. The moon-cow and the aurora-cow are
rich in pearls; they are pearls themselves, like the sun; the sun comes
out of the aurora, the pearl comes out of the cow. The subject of the seventh tale is the three sisters who,
taking the cattle to pasture, lose a buffalo, or black bull. In their
search for it, they came across an enchanted castle, tenanted by a white
bird, who offers to marry them. The third sister consents, and marries
him. The bird turns out then to be a handsome cavalier (a form of
Lohengrin). But having, by the advice of a witch, burned the aviary, she
loses him, and cannot recover him till the aviary is restored. We shall
see the sun as a bird in the Vedic hymns; the aurora is the aviary, made
of flames, of this divine bird. When the aviary is burned at morn, the
aurora and the sun separate; they meet again in the evening, when the
aviary is reconstructed. Another beautiful myth of analogous import occurs again in the eighth
story. A woodman and a painter envy each other; the painter makes the
king believe that the woodman's father, who is in heaven, has written
ordering his son to repair to paradise, in order to build him a temple,
and to take the route that the painter shall indicate. The king orders
the woodman to set out for paradise. The painter prepares a funeral
pyre, by way of exit; from this the woodman succeeds in escaping, and,
going back to the king, he tells him that he has been to paradise, and
presents a letter which his father has given him, ordering the painter
to come by the same road, and paint the temple. The king requires the
summons to be obeyed, and the perfidious painter perishes in the flames. The morning sun emerges safe and sound from the flames of the morning
aurora; the evening sun passes through those flames, and dies. The tenth Calmuc tale gives us the myth of the two brothers; the rich
one avaricious and wicked, and the poor one virtuous. The story ends in
a manner analogous to that of the dying adulterer, who, as we have seen
in the Tuti-Name, bites off his mistress's nose. The eleventh story is a variation of that of the lover, or husband,
who abandons or kills his wife, after having despoiled her of her
riches; but instead of the waters of the sea, we have here the sea of
sand, the sandy desert, in a cavity of which is deposited the young
girl, shut up in a chest, the same chest which in other popular tales
drifts about on the surface of the water.[331] But into the place where it was
laid, the chest having been taken away by a young prince, a tiger
enters; the unworthy husband turns up himself to abstract the chest, and
is torn to pieces by the tiger. The sterile night is a vast desert, a
sea of waters, a sea of sand; the sun-prince frees the aurora from the
waters, out of the well, or the cavern of the desert; the tiger kills
the monster-husband. In the twelfth tale, a thief steals the enchanted gem from the
prince; he throws the gem to the ground, the consequence of which is
that the prince's nose bleeds so excessively that he dies. The nose is
the most prominent part of the face, the most conspicuous and splendid
part; it is the gem of the sun-prince. The sun falls at night upon the
mountain; the gem falls to the ground; the prince's nose bleeds; he has
struck his nose against the ground, and it bleeds. The sun-prince dies,
and the evening sky is tinged red, blood-colour; the sun, who loses his
blood in the evening, dies. The thirteen Calmuc stories are followed by ten Mongol tales; in all,
twenty-three, of which the sixteenth, however, is lost. The fourteenth tells us of the rich and avaricious man whose poor
brother goes in despair into the forest to die upon a rock; but his
presence not being known to the
spirits, he has the good luck to come upon a hammer and a sack, of which
the former, when struck against an object, produces whatever is desired
by the owner, the latter being used to carry away the objects thus
obtained, this hammer and this sack having been left there by the
hobgoblins. Thus the poor brother becomes rich, and is envied by the
other, who goes to the same place, in hopes of experiencing the same
good fortune; but as he does not hide himself, the hobgoblins see him,
and believing him to be the man who stole the hammer and the sack,
avenge themselves upon him by lengthening his nose, and covering it with
protuberances. To this myth may perhaps be referred the origin of the
Italian expression, "Restare con uno o due palmi di naso," to remain
with one or two spans of the nose; that is to say, to be laughed at, and
with the gesture by which derision is accompanied, and which is
addressed to the man who is laughed at, by applying one or sometimes
both hands to the end of one's nose. The poor brother, now rich, visits
the miserly brother, who has a long nose covered with protuberances, and
knocks them off with his hammer. He had already knocked off eight, and
only one remained, when, at his wife's request, he desisted and left the
last one on. The rich man's wife, seeing how the protuberances had been
taken off by striking them, tries herself to remove the last one, and
strikes it with a hammer; but not calculating her aim accurately, she
splits her husband's head open, and he dies. In the seventeenth Mongol story, an old man and an old woman have
nine cows. The old man is fond of meat, and eats all the calves; the old
woman, on the other hand, has a great liking for milk and butter, with
which she satiates herself. When the old man has eaten all the calves,
he thinks that one cow more or less will not
affect his wealth; reasoning thus, he eats all the cows except one,
which he spares out of respect for the whim of his old wife. But one day
that the old woman is out, the old man cannot resist the temptation, and
kills the last cow. His wife returns, is angry, and abandons him, upon
which he throws after her one of the cow's breasts. The woman, in
grateful memory of the milk and butter she liked so much, takes it up
and goes up the mountain, where she strikes the cow's breast against the
summit of the rock, and thereupon there flow out milk and butter in
rivers. She satisfies her appetite, and then remembers that her husband
is perhaps dying of hunger, feeding, as he does, upon ashes; she
therefore, but secretly, throws butter into the house down the chimney,
and then disappears. In this attention the old man recognises the love
of his wife, and resolves upon the plan of following her footsteps
during the night upon the snow. He comes to the mountain, sees the
breast, and cannot resist the temptation it offers; he eats it, and
takes the butter away with him. The old woman wanders about till she
comes upon a herd of deer, who pasture freely, and who, instead of
fleeing, let themselves be milked. Again, she thinks of her husband, and
she throws deer's butter down the chimney. The old man follows her over
the snow, finds her near the deer, and kills them in his inordinate
passion for meat. The old woman continues to wander about, and stumbles
this time upon a cavern of the wild beasts, guarded by a hare. The hare
defends her from the wild beasts; but she then conceives the idea of
giving her husband a stick, and throws it down the chimney whilst he is
taking the ashes up with a spoon. He follows her, and comes to the cave
of the wild animals, who, seeing them arrive together, tear them to
pieces. Here again we have the myth of the sun and the aurora (or the
fine season); the
hare who guards the cavern and tames the wild beasts is, as we shall see
in the chapter which treats of it, the moon, the cows and the deer being
the same. The ferocious animals of the cavern of night rend both sun and
aurora (or fine season), both old man and old woman. The eighteenth Mongol story is too indecent for me to relate, or for
the reader to peruse; suffice it to say, that we have in it a comic
variation of the Amazon heroine, and that this heroine calls herself
SÃ»rya (the sun) Bagatur (to which corresponds the bagatÃ­r; or hero, of
the Russians). In the twentieth tale we have a calf and a lion's whelp brought up
together by a lioness upon the same milk.[332] When grown, the lion goes and
inhabits the forest, or the desert, and the bull, the mountain illumined
by the sun, meeting as good friends and brothers to drink the same
water. This good understanding is, however, put an end to by their
perfidious uncle the fox, who persuades the lion to believe that the
bull designs to kill him, and adds that when the bull in the morning
strikes the ground with his horns, and bellows loudly, will be the sign
that he is going to carry his purpose into effect; he then tells the
bull that the lion has a similar design against him. In the morning,
when the two brothers, bull and lion, go to drink the same water, they
approach each other with suspicion, engage in battle and kill each
other, the fox, or wolf, being the only one to benefit by the quarrel. This is a form of the story of the two twilights (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u), which we
shall illustrate in the following chapter. The beginning of the twenty-first Mongol story offers a new analogy
with the apologue of Perrette.[333] A poor father
and mother find a little lamb's-wool; they consult together, and resolve
with the wool to make cloth, and with the cloth to buy an ass. Upon this
ass they will place their little child, and go a-begging; by begging
they will become yet richer, and buy another ass. Of the two, a young
ass will be born. The youngster immediately exclaims that if a young
donkey is born he will ride upon it; whereupon his mother answers, "You
would break its back," when, accompanying these words with the movement
of a stick, she strikes the youngster's head with it, and kills him;
with him the fine projects of the poor parents also vanish. In the last of the stories of Siddhi-kÃ»r, which is joined to
the three legends of the grateful animals, the disguises, and the
laughing princess, a man uses the horns of his dead buffalo to grub up
the roots upon which he lives in exile. The history of Ardshi-Bordshi also contains several
interesting stories. It begins with a challenge among the children who keep the king's
cows to run a race from the summit of a mountain. The first who comes to
the winning-post is honoured as a king by his companions for that day,
and acts and judges on the spot where the race takes place as a real
king; indeed, he judges and decides as a court of final appeal on cases
which have not been well examined by the great king of the country. He
unmasks and convicts robbers and false witnesses acquitted by the king
as innocent, and sends a missive to the king, recommending him to be
more cautious in future in his judgments, or else to resign his royal
dignity. The great king wonders at the extraordinary wisdom of the king
of the children, and ascribes his preternatural sagacity to the magical
influence of the mountain where the children who
guard the cows play their games. On another occasion, the king of the
children, by his craftiness, detects a demon in one whom the king had
thought to be the legitimate son of his minister. The discovery is made
by means of a challenge to the minister's real son and his demoniacal
counterfeit to get into a small jug at hand. The real son cannot; but
the supposititious makes himself small and enters the jug, in which the
king of the children shuts him up with a diamond, and administers
thereupon fresh reproof to the great king for his carelessness. The
great king then visits the mountain of the children, and sees a golden
throne with thirty-two steps emerge from the ground; upon each step
there is a wooden puppet (the moon). The great king has the throne
carried into his palace, and endeavours to ascend it; the puppets arrest
him, and one of them tells him that this was once the throne of the god
Indras, and afterwards of King VikramÃ¢dityas. The great king inclines
himself in reverence, and one of the puppets begins to narrate the
history of VikramÃ¢dityas. The history of VikramÃ¢dityas, narrated by the puppets, refers to a
wise child, born of the wife of the king, after she had eaten a cake
made of earth mixed with oil, and dissolved in water in a porcelain vase
(of which cake the servant-maid eats the remainder). The young
VikramÃ¢dityas passes his infancy in the forests, where he learns all the
arts, not excluding the art of thieving, taught him by the most
experienced robbers, as well as every kind of mercantile fraud; by
cheating, he becomes possessed of an enchanted gem which was in the hip
of a dead man, and of a child who has the faculty of understanding the
language of the wolves, and who calls himself son of the wolves, but
was, in fact, born by the roadside of the maid who had eaten the rest of
the cake; this child is nursed by
his mother, and although at first ill-favoured, becomes in the long run
very handsome. VikramÃ¢dityas afterwards kills the king of the demons in
battle, in which it is remarkable that as many new demons arise to
combat him as there are pieces into which the hero cuts the demon, until
the hero multiplies himself in his turn, and to every demon opposes a
lion sprung from his own body. VikramÃ¢dityas mounts upon a throne where
those who had sat before him had all perished, each after a reign of
twenty-four hours, because they had omitted to offer up funeral
sacrifices to the dead during the night; VikramÃ¢dityas, with his
companion, the son of the wolf, fulfils the sacred duty, and escapes
death. In the same story, which reminds us of the á¹ibhavas and the
four cups and the cow, four young shepherds, one after another, work at
the same piece of wood; one gives it the general shape of a woman, the
second colours it, the third imparts the features peculiar to the
feminine form, and the fourth gives it life; they then dispute for her
person. The case is referred to the king; a wise man pronounces that the
two first who worked the wood are the father and mother, the third is
the priest, the fourth, who gave it life, is the legitimate husband. Thus the four become three, by making a group of the first two. Next comes the legend of the wife who, taking her husband by the
feet, makes him fall into a fountain, because she hears a melodious
voice, perhaps an echo of her own, which charms her; she sees a monster
instead, and bewails her lost husband. In zoological mythology, the
fable of the dog who, at the sight of his own shadow, lets the meat drop
into the river, is analogous to this legend, which, however, we
introduce here, only because of its relation to the similar stories of
the wife who kills her
husband, and of the husband who kills his wife by throwing her into the
water, already vaguely hinted at in the Vedic hymns. The last of the tales contained in the history of Ardshi
Bordshi shows us, on the other hand, a far too complaisant wife. A
king has a daughter, named Light of the sun, who is to be seen by no
one. The daughter asks to be allowed to go out into the city to walk on
the 15th of the month (at full moon); this granted, the king orders
every one to stay that day in his house, and all the doors and windows
to be shut; and capital punishment is the penalty of disobeying the
king's command. (The like occurs again in the British legend of Godiva,
the Countess of Mercia, in the eleventh century.) A minister, Ssaran by
name (moon), cannot repress his curiosity, and observes her from a
balcony; the girl makes signs to him, inviting him to join her; the wife
of the inquisitive minister interprets the signs to him, and urges him
to overtake the beautiful girl, giving him, at parting, a pearl of
recognition. Light of the sun and Light of the moon meet at the foot of
a tree, and spend the night until sunrise in amorous dalliance. One of
the persons employed to guard the princess discovers this intrigue, and
denounces it before the king; the wife of the minister Ssaran
ascertains, by means of the pearl, that her husband is in danger; she
rejoins him, disguises and disfigures him, suggesting a formula of oath
by which Light of the sun swears that it was the monster, and the
monster only she embraced; which seeming impossible to the king and
courtiers, the minister Ssaran and Light of the sun are acquitted. (The
aurora, or the sun, hides during the night, and no one sees, no one is
allowed to see her; the god Lunus shows himself; he remains during the
night with the sun, or with the solar aurora, whom no one
can see during the night; the god Lunus then transforms and disfigures
himself, so that he becomes unrecognisable, invisible; the guilty one
glides away, and escapes; it then seems impossible that the god Lunus,
who is no longer seen, can have been with the light of the sun; their
loves having come to an end, the adulterers being separated, their guilt
is no longer believed, their innocence is recognised, and the morality
of the myth is left to take care of itself as best it can.)

But the Calmuc and Mongol stories Siddhi-kÃ»r, and the
history of Ardshi Bordshi, being, as they are, only paraphrases
of Hindoo tales, would not alone suffice to prove the derivation from
the zoological legends of Aryan mythology of the oral Turco-Finnic
tradition, properly speaking. We must, therefore, search for the proofs
of their influence in other quarters as well. A Turanian story of the south of Siberia[334] combines together several of the
mythical subjects which we are already acquainted with. a
blind old woman are eating out of a golden cup, which of itself fills
with meat as they empty it (the moon). The hungry youth helps himself to
some of this meat, but the old man finds, as he continues to eat the
food, that some one has put his teeth into it; with a hook, which he
whirls around him, he clutches hold of the young man, who begs for his
life, pledging himself to be the eye of her who has no eyes, and the
foot of him who has no feet. This proposal pleases the old couple, and
they adopt him as their son; he makes himself a bow and a wooden arrow,
and goes to hunt wildfowl for their support. The old man lends him his
iron-grey horse, one day old, but advises him to ride him only by day;
the young man, thinking that by night he conceals treasures, cattle, and
people, disobeys, and rides by night. What the horse then does we shall
see in the next chapter. The youth fights and vanquishes the demon, by
fastening one of his lips to the heavens, and the other to the earth;
the defeated demon advises him to rub himself with the fat of his
stomach; inside his stomach he will find a casket of silver, inside that
a casket of gold, and inside that another casket of silver; he is to
take it and throw it into the sea of milk. From the monster's stomach,
cut open, come forth innumerable animals, men, treasures, and other
objects. Some of the men say, "What noble man has delivered us from the
black night? what noble man has shown us the clear day?" The youth finds
in the caskets money and a white handkerchief, which he puts into his
pocket; from the last casket come forth more men, animals, and valuables
of every kind; he drives the white cattle before him and returns home,
where the old couple are asleep. He opens the handkerchief, and finds in
it the old woman's eyes; whilst he is smoking near the fire, the old
people waken, see him, and

embrace him. The old man then endows him with the power of transforming
himself into a fox, a wolf, a lion, a vulture, and other shapes, at
will. He goes, to find for himself a wife, to the residence of the
prince Ai-Kan; the latter promises to give his daughter to whoever will
bring him the necessary amount of gold. It is in the shape of a
vulture

[335] that the young man sets out to
search for it; he then wins the young maiden who has the gold, and she,
who is herself the daughter of Ai-Kan, says to him, "Thou art my
husband." After various other transformations, in one of which the two
lean camels reappear,

wives; 13th, His revenge on his persecuting father. The legend is in
itself an epic poem, and we can only regret that the Altaic
story-tellers did not give it a more artistic form than that in which it
appears in the excellent collection of Radloff. Another interesting Turanian story, in the same collection, which
preserves several traces of the primitive myth, is another version of
the story of the hero who solves the riddle proposed by his
father-in-law, and thus wins his wife. A father has three sons; the
first-born dreams that their cow has devoured a wolf; he goes to see,
and finds it is true (the aurora destroys the night). We have already
seen that, as the third brother is the wise child, so the first-born of
the three is often the one who possesses the secret of solving riddles. The father of the three brothers wishes to obtain a wife for his
first-born son, and the bride's father, to give her up, demands that the
bridegroom's father should come to take her, arriving, the first time,
with a fur-coat and without one (in the morning the old man, by the
advice of the eldest son, departs wearing a coat of fur which seems to
be one, but is not, being in reality a coat of mail), and coming, the
second time, without touching the road, yet not off the road, on
horseback, yet without horses (the old man, by the advice again of his
first-born son, arrives at the father-in-law's abode, going on the side
of the road, and riding on a stick; thus he obtains permission to take
the bride away for his son). Professor Schiefner gives a Finnic variation of the same story. A
king orders the son of a peasant to come neither by day nor by night,
neither by the road nor by the road-side, neither on horseback nor on
foot, neither dressed nor naked, neither inside nor outside. The
intelligent boy makes a robe of goat's skin, goes to the city
lying in the bottom of a coffin, during the morning twilight, having a
sieve fastened to one foot, and a brush to the other, and stops on the
doorstep of the antechamber, with one leg out and the other in. Such was the humour, and such the wisdom of our fathers; ingenuity
was measured by skill in solving astronomical riddles. Now the riddles
have taken another form; they are strokes of diplomacy, amorous
hieroglyphs, ethical ambiguities, metaphysical nebulosities, which we,
the men of progress, must solve; but not wishing to acknowledge our
inferiority in acuteness to the children of the legends, we are fain to
persuade ourselves that the new riddles are more obscure than the
ancient. In the Vedic riddles proposed to one another by the aurora and the
sun, we have seen how they were solved in the morning by the nuptials of
the guesser and the guessee. Thus in the two riddles which we have just
described, the son of the old man and the child solve the riddle in the
morning. As to the sieve, the brush, and the coffin, they are mythical
furniture of great interest and obvious import. The nocturnal sky is the
great coffin; to sweep the sky of night, we must have a brush; to sunder
the good grain from the bad during the night, as the cruel mother-in-law
commands, we must have a sieve; the child-sun arrives, in the twilight,
in the bottom of the coffin, at the doorstep of the royal palace, and
presents to the maiden aurora (the Vedic cleaner or purifier) the brush
and the sieve. The sun, at twilight, is neither in nor out. In the
second Scottish story of Mr J. F. Campbell, the giant commands the hero,
among other things, to cleanse, in one day, the stables which had not
been cleansed for seven years (HeraklÃ©s and Augeias). But let us continue our subject, for the path is a long one. A Mongol tradition, contained in the Mongol Crestomathy of
Papoff,[336] speaks of the boy who comes riding
upon a black ox, instead of in a coffin. [337] has become strong, and breaks his
iron cradle (the iron sky of night is the cradle of the young sun); from
the horns of six roebucks he makes himself a bow; from the skin of a
colossal marine animal (the cloud, the gloomy one), he makes a string
for the bow (the string of the Hindoo bow is also called

chapter
what he does with his horse;–suffice it to notice here, that, in the
end, he meets the black bull, who will one day be the king of the AltaÃ¯. The soul of the black bull takes refuge in a red thread in the middle of
the rainbow (in the popular belief of the East the rainbow was supposed
to be a bridge, a road traversed by the souls of mortals); the young Kan
PÃ¼dai transfixes it with his arrows. He wins the white cattle, kills the
monstrous Kara Kula, and, taking the latter's wife and daughter with
him, returns home; and for seven days there is eating, drinking, and
festivity in the house of Kan PÃ¼dai. But up to this point it is not said
that he has espoused the daughter and the wife of Kara Kula. Kan PÃ¼dai
is, on the contrary, passionately enamoured of TÃ¤mÃ¤n ÃkÃ¶, the daughter
of the sky (duhitar divas, or daughter of the sky, is the name usually
given to the aurora in the Vedic hymns), and ascends, in order to secure
her and make her his wife, to the third heaven (it is the third step of
Vishá¹us; it is the third brother, the sun of the third night-watch, who
carries off the palm against the gloomy monster). In order to become
worthy of the daughter of the sky, Kan PÃ¼dai has to kill two monsters;
to scatter ashes on the field of victory, and lead away from it the
white cattle; to catch the three bears; to take the three black bulls
and make them swallow three hills; to take the tiger and give it the
grass of the three mountains to eat; to kill the whale in the azure sea
(all different forms of one and the same mythical and heroic battle);
and, finally, to play upon the mountain-peak with the golden-haired
monster Andalma. He then obtains his bride, and returns with her to his
own country, where he hunts, and makes war, and vanquishes all his
enemies, until he grows old; he then renounces all except his old
companion (the old sun and the old aurora meet again in the
evening). Here evidently the mythology is really zoological. In the complicated legend of Ai-Kan, we have in the brother Altyn
Ayak, who sleeps in the form of a golden cup, and who awakens to help
Ai-Kan, a figure which, though not the same as, is similar to, that of
the sleeping brother Kumbhakará¹as (conch-ear) in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am,
who awakens to help RÃ¢vaá¹as. We have the inebriating liquor which gives
strength to the hero, who is resuscitated three times from death, after
having been the food of dogs; the wolves who devour Sary-Kan, or the
fair-haired prince; the hero (the sun) who beats the wife (the aurora)
given him by the two brothers (the AÃ§vinÃ¢u); the friendly dog and cat;
the golden cup in which the brother of Ai-Kan is shut up asleep, and
which falls into the sea; the grateful animals which search for the cup;
the gem found in the stomach of a fish (from the whale of the nocturnal
ocean the gem comes forth); and the consequent awakening of the sleeping
Altyn Ayak. The following is from an Altaic saga, in the collection of
Radloff:–Beyond the sea, on a rock surrounded with treasures, a dwarf
girl is brought up, against whom aggressive warriors can prevail
nothing. She sends all enemies away, after loading them with gold and
silver, and placing on their heads part of the hair of her forehead,
which proves to be sufficient to cover seven men. In this marvellous
hair, in this enchanted maiden, and in the warriors who come by sea, who
does not recognise the veil of the maiden aurora of the VedÃ¢s, who
uncovers her bosom before the sun her husband, and the sea which the
warrior-sun crosses, and from which he emerges to come to the
aurora?–who does not recognise the golden fleece, Jason, Medea, the
Argonauts of Hellenic tradition? In the Finnic mythology of the Kalevala[338] also, we have upon the mountain a
good and pure hostess, a generous giver, from the golden windows of
whose house are observed the women who give the wildfowl; but in this
Finnic representation, it is not the heroic girl-aurora, it seems to me,
we recognise, but the moon, Diana the huntress (the German
HelljÃ¤ger), who also appears on the mountain-peak, surrounded
by the stars of the nocturnal forest, where the wildfowl is found, which
she can therefore lavish upon the hero. The Finns worship a thundering god, united with the clouds, who has
the thunderbolt for his sword, and who is called Ukko,[339] father of VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen, the
valorous and wise hero, who speaks in the womb of his mother, who
performs prodigies when yet a child, and who produces the sun and the
moon. enemy,
who wears here the well-known aspect of the trunk of a tree, or of a
dark forest. The woodcutter is therefore a favourite figure in popular
tradition. And the fact that VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen, having grown old and truthful
in speech, cuts down in the

[340] by the help of the little god, the
prodigious oak, shows us that this little god is a new and junior form,
a younger and victorious brother, or self-reproduction of the erewhile
child-hero VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen, who has lived his life of a day. The valiant
child-sun of morning has become the experienced old sun of evening; but
as this old sun is not strong enough to cut down the oak-tree, under
whose shadow he loses himself, he is obliged to become a child again to
develope the requisite amount of strength; he needs a younger brother, a
hero or dwarf-god, to free him from the evil shades of the forest of
night. To this end he also invokes the sun and the moon to illumine the
forest, and also the bear (the middle brother)–(in the

Alongside of the dwarf, by force of antithesis, there arises, even in
the Finnic mythology, the idea of a giant, a Titan who amuses himself
with uplifting and hurling rocks and mountains. The cloud, the monster
of darkness,
being represented as a mountain, the monster inhabiting this country
must fight by means of the mountain itself. The cloudy mountain moves;
it is a giant monster that moves it; it is the second brother, the
strong brother, the son of the cow, the bear, who amuses himself with
it, who shakes, carries, and throws it like a weapon. And such mythical
battles must have seemed so much the more natural in the age in which
the greater number of the myths were conceived and produced, as we know
it to have been the age which archÃ¦ologists call the age of stone. The
sun, as a dwarf, destroys the vast cloud, the vast darkness, viewed as a
giant. [341]

The
epopee of the Finns contains, moreover, several other myths cognate with
those of Aryan mythical tradition;–such as the resuscitated hero; the
winning of the maiden by display of heroism; the bride heroically won
and afterwards cut in pieces; the cup of abundance, or the cornucopia
(the Sampo); the golden cradle; the marvellous vessel in which the hero
crosses the sea; the three sisters, of whom one gives black milk, one
white, and one red (night, the alba or moon, and aurora); the
invulnerable shirt; the magician who makes children of gold and silver;
and others of secondary importance,

[342] but all tending to prove that
formerly the Turanian and Aryan races, in their neighbouring abodes,
were originally much more similar to each other than they now appear, on
account of partly diversity of language, and partly their different
degrees of civilisation. I have just named the Finnish Sampo as a cup of abundance or
cornucopia; it does, in fact, yield marvellous abundance to whoever
possesses it, and wherever it falls. It is made of the feather of a
swan, or of a duck (the swan and the duck are, as we shall see,
confounded together in tradition, and the duck, like the hen, is a
symbol of abundance), of a tuft of wool, of a grain of corn, and of
chips from a spindle, all evident symbols of abundance; and it becomes
so large that it has to be carried by a hundred-horned ox (reminding us
of the horns of the cow which spin). The ox bears abundance upon its
horns, it yields abundance from its horns. The cornucopia is, in my
mind, unmistakably implied in these mythical data. The
same mythical correspondence which we have found to exist between the
Finnic epos and the various legendary Aryan traditions is observable
between the latter and the Esthonian popular tales. In the collection of
Frederic Kreuzwald[343] we find numerous proofs of this
correspondence. In the first story we have, in a hut in the forest, three sisters, of
whom the youngest is the most beautiful. The old witch, her step-mother,
persecutes her, and always gives her filaments of gold to spin, hiding
from time to time the gold she has spun in a secret room. During the
summer the old woman goes out of the house, no one knows where, after
having apportioned their respective tasks to the three sisters. While
the old woman is out, a young prince, having lost himself in the forest,
finds his way to the hut, and becomes enamoured of the youngest of the
three sisters. The young couple speak to each other of love in the light
of the moon and of the stars; while the old king, impatient at the
absence of his son, falls into grief, and sends everywhere to look for
him. After three days he is found; before going back to the palace, he
secretly promises to the youngest sister that he will return. Meanwhile
the old woman comes back, finds the work badly done, curses, threatens,
and maltreats the girl. Early in the morning, while the old woman and
the two elder sisters are slumbering, the maiden slips out, and leaves
the house. During her childhood she had learned the language of birds;
accordingly, when she meets a crow, she salutes him by the name of "bird
of light," and sends him as a messenger to the young prince, to warn him
not to come back to see her,
on account of the fury of the old woman. The prince then names her
another trysting-place, and the young couple meet under a tree, between
the second and third crowing of the cock; and when the sun rises, they
flee away together. The old witch causes them to be followed by a ball
made of nine evil herbs, and carried by malignant winds. The fugitives
are overtaken on the banks of a river, where the ball strikes the
prince's horse; it rears up on its hind legs, and the girl falls off
into the river, into the hands of a marine monster; upon which the
prince is struck by a disease which no one can cure. By eating the flesh
of a hog, the prince acquires a knowledge of the language of birds; he
sends the swallows as messengers to the magician of Finland, that he may
teach him the way to free a girl who has been transformed into a
pond-rose (lotus-flower). The answer, instead of being brought by the
swallows, is brought by an eagle. The prince must become a shrimp, in
order to enter the water without being drowned; he must detach the lotus
by its root, draw it along the surface of the water to the bank, near a
stone, and pronounce these words, "From the pond-rose, a maiden–from the
shrimp, a man." The crow confirms the eagle's words. The prince hears a
song issue from the rose; he then determines to deliver the girl. The
two young people emerge together from the water. The maiden is ashamed
of being naked, and the prince goes to procure nuptial robes for her;
after which he conducts her to the palace in a beautiful chariot, where
a joyous and gorgeous wedding-festival is celebrated. Soon afterwards
the old witch dies, to appear again in the form of a cat, which is taken
by the tail and flung into the fire. In the witch's house are found
mountains of spun gold, which serve for the dowry of the three sisters. We have already said that the three sisters
correspond to the three brothers, and the youngest sister to the
youngest brother. The epithet of young is often given to the
Vedic aurora, whom the sun marries. Here the prince marries the youngest
of the three sisters; the morning aurora is united to the sun. Towards
night she falls into the water; it is the witch (night) who throws her
in; the hog which the prince (the sun) eats we shall see to be a
figurative representation of the nocturnal monster, or the moon. Eating
the hog, staying in the forest of night, the prince learns the language
of birds. The prince frees the maiden from the waters; the sun delivers
the aurora from the gloomy ocean of night, and robes her in his
splendour, causing the witch of night to be burned in the flames of the
aurora, and taking from the witch's abode the spun gold or golden
fleece. In the third Esthonian story, a woman, called mother-of-gold, bears,
by the favour of a dwarf, three dwarf-sons at the same time, who become
three heroes. The first is the seer (the wise brother), the second has a
ready arm (the strong brother), the third runs swiftly in the race (a
quality distinctive of the third brother, ArÇµunas, in the
MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, and which is applicable to the victorious sun of
morning, who wins the race, together with the aurora). A variation of the story relating to the youngest sister and the
dwarf is that of the girl seven years old, the wise girl (the aurora),
in the fourth Esthonian tale, who, being persecuted by her step-mother,
retires into the forest (the night). While there, it seems to her that
she is in heaven, where, in a house of crystal and pearls, she is
received by a well-dressed woman of gold (the fair-haired moon). The
girl asks the golden woman to be allowed to take care of the cattle,
like the cowmaid aurora. In the history of Ardshi Bordshi we
have seen the wise
puppet. This form of the wise girl, the dressed girl of wood, occurs
again in the Esthonian story; in which she is made of wood from the
forest, of three anchovies, of bread, of a black serpent, and of the
blood of the girl herself, to whom the image has a great likeness, and
which may be beaten by the old step-mother without being hurt. From the
forest-tree, wood, or wooden box of the night, with the juice of the
black serpent of night and the blood of the girl aurora of evening,
comes forth the maiden aurora of morning, the wise, the speaking puppet,
the puppet who guesses the riddles. The girl who comes out of wood is
represented as a wooden puppet; more frequently the puppet is the moon,
the wise fairy who comes out of the forest. In the same story we have
the magic rod which produces a cock upon the mountain, beside which a
tablecloth spreads itself out, while the chairs range themselves in
their places, and the dishes are filled of their own accord. The story
ends with the usual marriage between the beautiful maiden, and a king's
son returning from the chase (or the son who comes out of the forest of
night, viewed as infested by ferocious animals). In the sixth Esthonian tale, the poor girl finds a woman in a white
robe (the moon), adorned with gold, upon a rock near a fountain, who
announces her approaching marriage with a youth as poor as herself; but
the good fairy godmother–for in the legends the godmother is represented
as good, as the stepmother is wicked–promises to make them both rich and
happy. She calls herself the lady of the waters, secret wife of the
wind, and she judges the criminals who present themselves at her
tribunal (Proserpina or PersephonÃª). In the seventh tale, a boy nine years of age, the third son
of two poor people, goes out to be a cowherd; his master treats him
well, but his mistress gives him more floggings than bread. One day the
young cowherd is unfortunate enough to lose a cow; he searches for it
all through the forest, but in vain. He re-enters the house with the
cattle, after the sun has set some time. The observant eye of his
mistress perceives at once that there is a cow missing; she beats the
boy without pity, and sends him out to look for it, threatening to kill
him if he returns without it. He wanders through the forest; but when
the sun arises from out the bosom of the dawn, he resolves to stay out
of the house, and not to return to his persecutor (the young morning sun
flees from the old and perverse night). In the evening, the boy finds an
old dwarf, who is his host during the night (the moon), and who says to
him, "When the sun rises to-morrow, carefully observe the spot in which
he rises. Thou must go in that direction, so that every morning thou
may'st have the sun before thee, and every evening the sun behind thee. Thus thy strength will increase more and more every day." How can one
indicate better the apparent course of the solar hero, or of the sun in
the night? The hero, in order to go towards the morning sun, must
necessarily have the sun of evening behind him. The old dwarf also gives
him a sack and a little barrel, in which he will always find the food
and drink he requires; but he recommends him never to eat or drink more
than is necessary, that he may have to give to a hungry bird or a
thirsty wild beast. He also leaves him a rolled-up leaf of burdock, upon
which, by rolling it out, he will always be able to cross water (a new
form of the cup). We know how the Hindoos represented their god as
floating upon a lotus-leaf in the midst of the waters, and how PadmaÇµas
(born of the lotus-flower, or
the rose of the waters, which shuts during the night) was one of the
names of BrÃ¢hman; here we have the god or hero shutting himself up in
the flower, from which he afterwards comes out. In the chapters on the
Serpent and the Frog we shall again see how the god sometimes shuts
himself up in a monstrous form in this flower, the rose, on account of a
curse from which he is to be freed by a beautiful maiden. We have seen
how the Esthonian girl, who was by the curse of the old woman thrown
into the water, was transformed into a water-rose or lotus-flower, and
delivered by the young prince. The Esthonian boy finds himself before a
small lake; he throws the leaf in, and it becomes a magical boat, which
carries him over. Meanwhile he has become strong. Upon the mountain he
sees a serpent, a tortoise, and an eagle, all three of enormous
dimensions, approaching to attack him, with a man upon a black horse,
which has wings on its feet, in the rear of them. He kills the serpent
and the tortoise, but the eagle flies away. The man with the black horse
takes the boy into his house, and appoints him to look after the dogs,
that they may not get loose from their chains, a danger against which
the man provides by making twelve colossal oxen fetch rocks upon rocks,
to repair the damage done by the dogs. The rocks, touched by a magical
rod, arrange themselves upon the car drawn by the oxen. At last, by the
advice of the eagle, he steals his master's horse, and departs to
sojourn among mankind, taking a wife with him. with
a woman who complains to him that her husband regularly beats her when
she is unable to procure for him the things he wants, which he asks for
in the form of a riddle. The third brother solves the enigma for the
woman (the moon), who, in gratitude, gives him provisions for his
travels. He then comes to a palace, where the king is engaged in
celebrating a summer festival, and he undertakes to provide and prepare
the feast. A magician presents himself at the festival in the shape of
an old man, and asks to taste the food. The young man suspects him, but,
seeing a ring upon his finger, he consents to allow him if he gives him
a pledge. The magician vows that he has nothing to give. The youth asks
for his ring, and the old man in his gluttony at once gives it up; upon
which the youth, who, along with the ring, has taken all the magician's
strength away, first binds and derides him, and then has him beaten by
seven strong men. The old man breaks the ropes and disappears; however,
the young man, having the ring in his hands, possesses the means of
tracking his footsteps and making him his. (This is the usual disc,
lasso, or bridle which is now in the hands of the hero, now in those of
the monster.) The youth follows the magician underground. The latter, it
appears, is served by three maidens, who, when they perceive that the
sorcerer has lost his ring, and that they have a young man for
companion, enjoy themselves with him while the magician is asleep. The
youth learns from them that the old wizard also possesses a sword which
can destroy armies, and a magical rod which can create a bridge to span
the sea; these, therefore, he steals, and departs, returning by a
wonderful bridge thrown over the sea to the palace whence he had
started. It seems to him as if his journey had lasted only two nights,
instead of which a year has

passed. [344] He finds on his arrival his two
brothers in the king's service, one as coachman and the other as a
valet, both enriched because they have received the pay due to their
younger brother for having prepared the great feast. The young man now
engages himself in another capacity, in a species of service especially
dear to the young hero, next to those of stable-boy and cowherd; that is
to say, he becomes under-cook of the king. (In the

he
arraigns them before him and has them judged. The third brother is named
Counsellor; with his enchanted sword he destroys an entire army of
enemies, and obtains in reward for his services and his valour the
king's daughter to wife. The ninth Esthonian story presents to us the son of the thunder, who
sells his soul to the devil, on condition that the latter serves him for
seven years. The time agreed upon is nearly come to an end, and the son
of the thunder wishes to escape from him, and profits by an opportunity
which has chanced. The devil sees a black cloud, which is a sign of an
approaching tempest; he is afraid, hides himself under a stone, and asks
the son of the thunder to keep him company. The latter consents; but
seeing that the devil is afraid, at each thunderclap he presses his ears
and eyes in such a manner as to make him perspire and shiver all over. The devil, believing this to be the effect of the thunder, promises the
son of the thunder that he will not only leave him his soul, but give
him three other souls, if he will deliver him from the evils which he
suffers on account of the thunder, by taking from the thundering god,
the father of the clouds, his weapon (which is also a musical
instrument). This weapon, having been ravished from the god, is taken by
the devil into hell, into a chamber of iron, shut up within seven
castles. A great drought coming upon the earth, the son of the thunder
repents of having rendered such a service to the devil; he finds means,
however, of informing the thunder-god where his weapon is concealed. The
thunder-god then becomes a child, and engages himself in the service of
a fisherman, near a lake which the devil is accustomed to visit to steal
the fishes. He surprises him in the act of robbery, and by the help of a
magician takes him prisoner, and has him beaten
without pity, until he promises to pay a heavy ransom in money to be let
free, the fisherman and his child to accompany him to hell itself to
receive the sum of money. Arrived in hell, the devil entertains them
like a gentleman. The child tells the fisherman to ask the devil to show
them the musical instrument which he keeps enclosed in the iron room. The devil kindly consents, but cannot draw from the instrument anything
more musical than the mewing of a cat or the grunting of a pig. The
fisherman then laughs at the devil, and says that his boy can play
better. The devil does not believe it, and laughingly gives the
instrument, which he calls bagpipes, to the boy. The latter blows into
them and makes such a noise that all hell resounds with it, and the
devils fall to the earth as if dead. The child then becomes the god of
thunder again, and returns to heaven, where by the noise of his
instrument he opens the celestial reservoirs and lets out the beneficent
rain. The description of the tempest which occurs in many Vedic hymns is
the germ of this interesting myth. The drum or kettledrum thunder is a
familiar image in Hindoo poetry, and the GandharvÃ¢s, the
musician-warriors of the Hindoo Olympus, have no other instrument than
the thunder. The conch of the warrior PÃ¢á¹á¸avÃ¢s in the
MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, and the famous horn of Orlando (which comes from
the golden horn of Odin), are epical reminiscences of thunder. Orpheus,
who in hell plays on his lyre and tames the animals, is a more lucid and
more perfect form of this Esthonian thunder-god who plays the bagpipes
in hell. It is also remarkable how, in harmony with the pastoral
bagpipes, in the tenth Esthonian story, which is a variation of the
preceding one, the god transformed into a powerful boy is called a
little shepherd or cowherd–another interesting
fact, which completes his identification with Orpheus.[345] The magic flute is a variation of
the same celestial musical instrument. The magic flute, the bagpipes or
wonderful pipe, occurs again in the twenty-third Esthonian story, in
which the good Tiidu, by means of it and of his virtue, obtains riches. The magical harp of Gunnar in the Edda has the same marvellous
effects. Evidently the monster-dwarf is a favourite subject of Esthonian
tradition, and it often occurs in the Hindoo and in the German
traditions, as well as in the Franco-Latin tradition of Charlemagne. The
eleventh story introduces us to three dwarf-brothers who contend for the
inheritance left by their father, consisting of a miraculous hat, which
enables its wearer to see everything, whilst he can himself be visible
or invisible at pleasure (this hat is made of pieces of men's nails cut
up);[346] of a pair of slippers which
transport the owner in an instant wherever he wishes (we must not forget
that Cinderella, when she loses the slipper, is overtaken by the prince
bridegroom); and of a stick which strikes of itself, and destroys
everything, even stronger than the thunderbolt (the thunderbolt itself). The three brothers maintain that these three articles, to be really
useful, must
be the property of one; but who is to enjoy this privilege? A man comes
up to put an end to the dispute, and feigns disbelief in the virtue of
these three things, unless he proves it himself. The three simpletons
give them to him that he may prove them. The man takes them off, and the
three dwarfs are left to meditate upon the truth of the above-quoted
proverb, "Between two disputers the third profits," or at least that
variation of it which their own case suggests "Between three that
dispute, the fourth profits."

In the thirteenth Esthonian story, the privileged character of the
third brother is explained, as we are told that he is the son of a king,
but was exchanged by a witch during his infancy for the child of a
peasant. The latter died in the palace, whilst the king's son grew in
the hut, showing in every action his royal pedigree. Here we have the
story of the hero who is exposed on the mountains intimately connected
with that of the third brother. To this third brother, who alone shows
himself to be devoted to his father, and who alone makes a vow to watch
by his grave, is also attributed the merit of having delivered, upon a
high mountain of crystal, from a seven years' sleep, a princess, who
then becomes his wife. We have seen the aurora-awakener in the Vedic
hymns–the sun and the aurora arouse each other: the sun sends forth the
aurora; the aurora draws out the sun. The myth reproduces itself every
day, and expresses in its entirety a daily phenomenon of light in the
heavens. In Northern countries, where the contrast is great between
winter and spring, and therefore the impression is striking which is
caused by the cessation of vegetation in autumn, the earth also assumed
the aspect of a dead young princess; but an omniscient magician having
said, Non est mortua puella, sed dormit, the
third brother, predestined to the enterprise, lays down his poor robes,
and dresses himself, on the first occasion, in the colour of bronze; on
the second, the colour of silver; on the third, the colour of gold, and
ascends the mountain of crystal, or ice, whence he brings forth the
beautiful spring. The sky, grey in autumn, snowy in winter, and golden
in spring, corresponds to the grey sky of evening, the silver one of
night, and the golden one of morning. Spring is the dawn of the year;
the primitive myth is but amplified; the last hour of the day awakens
the aurora; the last month of the solar year awakens the spring. The
application of the myth of the day to the year is one of the greatest
simplicity. funerals; and in the Greek belief, the dead carried vegetables with them
to hell, either for the right of passage or as provisions for
travelling. In Piedmont, it is still the custom on the second of
November (All Soul's Day) to make a great distribution of kidney-beans
to the poor, who pray for the souls of the dead. Vegetables, peas,
vetches, and kidney-beans are symbols of abundance, and to this belief
may be traced the numerous Indo-European stories in which mention is
made of beans which multiply themselves in the pipkin, or of peas which
grow up to the sky, and up the stalk of which the hero climbs to heaven. The vegetables necessary for being introduced into the kingdom of the
dead, and the pea by means of which the hero enters heaven, are
variations of the same mythical subject. In Hindoo tradition, besides
the pea or kidney-bean, we have the pumpkin as a symbol of abundance,
which is multiplied infinitely, or which mounts up to heaven. The wife
of the hero Sagaras gives birth to a pumpkin, from which afterwards come
forth sixty thousand sons. The kidney-bean, the pea, the vetch, the
common bean, and the pumpkin are also symbols of generation, not only on
account of the facility with which they multiply, but also on account of
their form. We have seen in the Vedic ceremonials what organs are
represented by the two kidney-beans; we shall also see, in the chapter
on the Ass, how the names given to the organs of generation are also
used to designate fools. Now, it is worthy of notice that the Sanskrit
word

meaning, and cited the Russian and Piedmontese custom of putting a black
and a white bean into the cake eaten at Epiphany, one of which
represents the male and the other the female, one the king and the other
the queen. The two who find the beans kiss each other with joyful
auguries. As all these vegetables personify the moon, which we know to
be considered as a giver of abundance, and which, by its form of a
turning ball, can well be represented by the turning pea, in this
personification we must search for the solution of the principal myths
relating to vegetables.–The young prince of the Esthonian story, having
obtained the stranger's favour in the gloomy forest by means of the
peas, engages himself in his service, with intent to deliver the girl
who had freed him by taking his place with the stranger during eighteen
years. He therefore follows him; but on the way he lets a pea fall to
the ground from time to time, in order to know the way back. He is
conducted by a strange and wild subterranean passage, where silence as
of the tomb reigns–it is, in fact, the kingdom of the dead–where birds
have the appearance of wishing to sing, dogs to bark, and oxen to low,
but cannot, and where the water flows without a murmur. The young prince
feels in his heart a kind of anguish; the universal stillness in the
midst of animated beings oppresses him. Having passed the region of
silence, they come to that of deafening noise. The young prince thinks
he hears the excruciating din of twenty-four saws at work; but the old
stranger tells him that it is only his grandmother who has fallen
asleep, and is snoring. At last they come to the stranger's dwelling,
where the prince finds the beautiful maiden, but the old stranger will
not let him speak. He sees in the stable a white horse and a black cow,
with a white or luminous-headed calf. This cow the

young prince is ordered to milk until there is not a drop of milk in its
breast; instead of milking it with his fingers, he, by the advice of the
girl, uses for that purpose red-hot pincers. Another time the youth is
told to lead away the enchanted calf with the white or luminous head. In
order that it may not escape, the girl gives him a magic thread, of
which one end is to be tied to the left leg of the calf, and the other
to the little toe of the prince's left foot.–The little finger, although
the smallest, is the most privileged of the five. It is the one that
knows everything; and in Piedmont, when the mothers wish to make their
children believe that they are in communication with a mysterious spy,
who sees everything that they do, they are accustomed to awe them by the
words, "My little finger tells me everything."–At last the two young
people resolve to flee. Before starting, the prince splits open the
forehead of the white-headed calf; from its skull comes forth an
enchanted little red ball, which shines like a small sun. He wraps it
up, leaving part of it uncovered to light the way, and flees away with
the girl. Being followed by malignant spirits, who are sent by the old
man to follow them, the two fugitives, by means of the enchanted little
ball (or pearl), turned round three times, become, first the one a pond
and the other a fish, then the one a rose-bush and the other a rose,
then again the one a breeze and the other a gnat, until the stone which
covers the entrance to the subterranean world having been lifted up,
they arrive again safe and happy upon the earth; and by means of the
little red ball, they show themselves to mankind in splendid and
princely robes. I scarcely think it necessary to explain to the reader
the sense of this lucid mythical story. The black cow which produces the
calf with the white or luminous head is a Vedic antithesis which we have
already

seen;

[347] the cow (night) produces the calf
(the moon). The prince takes the little red ball out of the calf; by
means of this ball, the girl is delivered from the regions of gloom. The
little ball moves the stone; the sun and the aurora come out together
from the mountain, after having travelled together in the kingdom of
shadows; the sun delivers the aurora. This story unites together and
puts in order several myths of an analogous character, but born
separately. The three next stories describe other voyages made by the solar hero
to heaven, or in hell, and end by meaning the same thing. In the
eighteenth story we again find the enchanted ring, called Solomon's
ring, which the young hero goes to search for; when he finds it, by
taking it from the daughter of hell, and puts it on his finger, he is of
a sudden endowed with such strength that he can split a rock with one
blow of his fist. The little red ball of the story just described, which
lifts up the rock, and this ring which splits the stone, represent the
same mythical object, i.e., the sun, the sun's ball or
disc. The twenty-first story shows us the fearless hero who frees a castle
from the presence of the demons, and who thus gains a treasure; riches
are the reward of valour. The
twentieth Esthonian story is a variation of the exceedingly popular tale
of Blue Beard, the killer of his wives. The Esthonian monster-husband
has already killed eleven, and is about to murder the twelfth, by way of
punishing her for having, against his express prohibition, visited the
secret room opened by the golden key (perhaps the moon), when a youth
who takes care of the goslings, the friend of her childhood, comes to
deliver her. From the subject itself, and the expressions used in this
story, we can discover the origin of the terrible charivari in the
nuptials of widowers or widows. This savage custom is intended not only
to deride the lust of the old man or woman who marries again, but to
warn the girl who marries the one, or the youth who marries the other,
of the possibility of a fate similar to the first wife or husband. When,
therefore, the wife apatighnÃ® (who does not kill her husband)
is praised to the Vedic husband, we must understand that the
patighnÃ® (or killer of her husband) is a widow, whom no one
must marry, as being suspected of murder. Hence, to free herself from
this suspicion, an honest Hindoo wife (like Gudrun in the Edda) was to
throw herself into the fire after the death of her husband; the evening
aurora, after the death of the sun, dies too. In the twenty-second story we have once more the myth of the young
pastoral hero; he is the son of a king. By the order of his step-mother,
a witch, who carries off shepherds, steals him from the palace during
his infancy, and abandons him in a solitary place, where he is brought
up by cowherds, and becomes himself an excellent cowherd. An old man
finds him and says, looking at him and at the cattle, "Thou dost not
seem to me born to remain a cowherd." The boy answers that he knows he
was born to command, and adds, "Here I learn the
duties of a commander by anticipation. If things go well with the
quadrupeds, I shall also prosper with bipeds." The shepherd is therefore
a little king; a good shepherd will become a good king. The boy goes
through several adventures, in which he displays his valour. A wicked
German lady wishes to take from him the strawberries which he has
plucked. He defends himself bravely; his mistress persecutes him; and he
takes twelve wolves, shuts them up in a cavern, and each day gives them
a lamb to eat, in order to avenge himself upon his wicked mistress, to
whom he simply says that the wolves have devoured them. At last he
causes her to be devoured herself by the wolves, who eat her all up,
leaving only the heart (the sun) and the tongue, which are too full of
venom for the wolves of the night, because they burn their mouths. At
the age of eighteen, the youth has several other adventures. He becomes
enamoured of a gardener's daughter, and is found again by the king his
father, who, before allowing him to marry the beautiful gardener's
daughter, wishes to prove that they are predestined to each other. He
cuts a ring in two with his sword, and gives one part to the young
prince and the other to the maiden; the two halves must be preserved by
both, and one day they will meet of themselves and form again the whole
ring, in such a manner that it will be impossible to find the place
where it was broken.–In a Tuscan story, the beautiful maiden gives half
her necklace to the third brother. The young couple lose each other;
their meeting again and mutual recognition take place when the two parts
of the necklace join each other. The use of the wedding-ring has a
mythical origin. The solar (and sometimes the lunar disc) is the ring
which unites the heavenly husband and wife.–When, after other
adventures, the two young people of the Esthonian
story join together the two halves of their ring, their misfortunes come
to an end; they marry and live together happily, whilst the cruel
step-mother, who meanwhile has become a widow, is expelled from the
kingdom. The last Esthonian story tells of the extraordinary births, in the
same day, of a handsome prince and a beautiful princess. The princess is
born in a bird's egg, laid like a pearl in the bosom of the queen; she
has at first the form of a living puppet, and afterwards, when warmed in
wool, she becomes a real girl. Whilst she undergoes this transformation,
the queen also gives birth to a beautiful boy. The two children are
considered as twins, and baptized together. To the baptism of the girl
there comes as godmother, in a splendid chariot drawn by six horses, a
young woman dressed in rose-coloured and golden robes, who shines like
the sun, and who, as she lets her veil drop, like the beautiful Argive
Helen, fills the bystanders with admiration. [The aurora, who, before
appearing in the form of a beautiful girl, is enclosed in the wood of
the forest, is a wooden puppet, and becomes a wooden puppet once more
when, fleeing from the sun, she hides herself in a creeping-plant, like
the Hindoo UrvaÃ§Ã® (the first of the dawns), or in a laurel-plant, like
the Hellenic Daphne (the Vedic DahanÃ¢-aurora). The aurora is born
together with the sun; the beautiful doll-maiden is born with the little
prince. The mother and the beneficent godmother seem to be the moon, or
a more ancient aurora.] The mother, dying, leaves her daughter, putting
it upon her breast, a gem which is to bring her happiness; that is, the
little basket which contained the bird's egg, with the eggshell itself. By means of the magical little basket, and by pronouncing some magic
words, the maiden can find all that she searches or wishes for. The
young man and woman end by
marrying each other, having discovered that, although both born of a
king, they are children of different fathers; they marry, and the little
basket of happiness mysteriously disappears. SECTION IV. The Bull and the Cow in Slavonic

the dew which gives eyesight; the girl finds her husband; a Russian
variety of the legend of Berta. Having drawn so far the general outline of the Turanian boundaries of
Slavonian tradition, it is now time to begin to study the tradition of
the Slaves itself, as far as it concerns the myth and the legend of the
bull and the cow. The Russian peasants and shepherds are accustomed to remark that the
weather will be fine when a red cow places herself at the head of the
herd, and that it will rain or be bad weather when, on the contrary, the
first of the cows to re-enter the stable at evening is a black one. We
already know what the black and the red cow signify in the language of
the VedÃ¢s. The aurora of morning and evening, that is, the red cows
promise fine weather; the cloud (or black cow) announces wet weather. In
Piedmont, when a beautiful evening aurora is observed, it is the custom
to say–

"Rosso di sera,

Buon tempo si spera."

(Red at eve, we hope for fine weather.)

Let us now follow the Russian tradition relating to the cow and the
bull in two of the many invaluable collections of popular stories
already printed in Russia, as well as in the celebrated fables of
Kriloff.[348] We
shall begin with those stories and fables in which the cow or the bull
is explicitly mentioned. They show us the bull who protects the hero and
the heroine, the bull who enriches the hero, the bull that is sold, the
grateful bull, the bull who sacrifices himself, the persecuted bull, the
demoniacal bull; the cow who spins, the beneficent cow, the son of the
cow, the birds that come out from the cow, the cow's hide which becomes
a rope to mount up to heaven, the cow exchanged, the demoniacal cow, the
cow's horns. Here, again, therefore, we have the double aspect of the
Vedic cow; the dark-coloured one (cloud and darkness), generally
monstrous, the luminous one (moon and aurora), usually divine and
beneficent. [349] absorbs the sea). But the bull,
who could dry up the river, refuses to do so on account of a debt of
gratitude he owes to the good maiden. The water where this bull, or cow,
belonging to the witch, drinks, has the property of transforming into a
calf the man who drinks of it;

[350] nay, to drink out of the hoof of
the bull itself is enough to turn him into a calf. [351] The water which comes out of the
hoof of the demoniacal bull is the opposite of the

water
of Hippokrene, which flows from the hoofs of the divine horse of the
Hellenes, the PÃªgasos. In the second book of Afanassieff, there is a story which
speaks of the exchange of animals in the very same order as in the
Ãitareya-brÃ¢hmaá¹am, i.e., the gold for a horse, the
horse for a cow, the cow for a goat or sheep. The Russian peasant goes
on with his unfortunate exchanges; he barters the sheep for a young pig,
the young pig for a goose, the goose for a duck, the duck for a little
stick with which he sees some children playing; he takes the stick home
to his wife, and she beats him with it. In the twelfth story of the
fifth book of Afanassieff, an old man also begins to barter the
golden stockings and silver garters received in heaven from God for a
horse, the horse for a bull, the bull for a lamb; his last exchange is
for a little needle, which he loses. In the second story of the sixth
book, the same foolish liberality is attributed to the third brother,
the stupid one (who, in another Russian variation of the same story, is
the cunning one), who, having learned that in heaven cows are cheap,
gives his cow for a fly, his ox for a horse-fly, and mounts up to
heaven. But, generally speaking, the bull and the cow are the beginning of
good luck for the heroes of popular tales. which some robbers had hidden in it;

[352] the young man then takes it up and
carries it home. In a variation of the same story, in the collection of

[353] the third son of the miller,
before going to sell his bull, or ox, seeing the second son milking the
cow, endeavours to milk the bull too; finding that his efforts are in
vain, he resolves upon selling an animal which appears to him to be so
utterly useless. In the thirty-fourth story of the fifth book of Afanassieff,
we meet again the two brothers, one rich and miserly, the other poor;
the poor one borrows from a neighbour two bulls, and is conducted by
Misery (gory) to a stone, under which he finds a cavity full of gold. The poor man fills his waggon, and, on coming out, tells Misery that
there is plenty more inside. Misery turns in to see; the ex-pauper
thereupon closes up the entrance with the stone, and returns home.[354]

But the bull and the cow do not only provide the hero with riches,
they help him in danger. In the eleventh story of
Erlenwein,[355] Ivan TzareviÄ, or the Prince
John,–the name of the favourite hero of Slavonian popular tradition (he
is the third brother, the strongest, the most fortunate, the victorious,
the most intelligent, after having been the most foolish)–wishes to flee
from the serpent, and, not knowing how, sits down on the trunk of a tree
and weeps. The hare comes to carry him away, but is killed
by the serpent; the wolf comes, but is killed too. At last the ox or
bull comes, and carries him off. Ivan having arrived at his dwelling,
the ox has himself divided in two; one part must be placed under the
sacred images, which ornament a corner of every room in Russian houses,
the other part under the window; Ivan must then look out sharp till two
dogs and two bears appear, who will serve him in the chase, and be his
strength. In the twenty-seventh story of the fifth book of
Afanassieff, Ivan TzareviÄ and the beautiful Helen are pursued
by a monstrous bear with iron bristles; they escape upon a bull (the
moon), and Ivan, by the bull's advice, rides him with his face turned
towards the place whence the pursuing bear is likely to come, in order
that he may not take them by surprise. When Ivan sees that the bear is
coming, the bull turns round and tears his eyes out; the blind bear
follows them still, but the fugitives pass a river on the bull's back,
in which the bear is drowned. Ivan and Helen feel hungry; the bull tells
them to cut him to pieces and eat him, but to preserve his bones, and to
strike them together; from the bones of the bull, when struck, a dwarf,
the height of a finger-nail, but with a beard a cubit long, comes out;
he assists Ivan in finding the milk of a wolf, a she-bear, and a
lioness, until he is swallowed by the burning bird, whose eggs he wished
to steal. (The bear is the night; the bull is the sun's steed in the
night, the moon; the bull-moon is sacrificed; then comes forth a little
sun with long rays, the dwarf with a long beard, an alter ego
of Ivan, who ends his life in the burning furnace of the phÅ“nix, or of
the evening aurora.) Ivan is threatened with death when the dwarf dies,
but he is at that moment helped by the wild beasts he had tamed and fed,
who save him from danger. These were, as we have seen before, given to
him after the death of the
bull, his deliverer, being born of the bull himself, cut in pieces (the
wild animals of the forest of night are born as soon as the evening sun
is sacrificed). The same subject occurs again, with some variations, in the
twenty-eighth story, which follows; only instead of John and Helen, we
have John and Mary, the sun and the aurora of the Christians. Near the
abode of Ivan and Mary a funeral pile arises, on which the bull
sacrifices himself. The bull's bones are sown in three furrows; from the
first furrow a horse comes forth, from the second a dog, and in the
third an apple-tree grows up. Ivan mounts upon the horse, followed by
the dog, and hunts wolves' whelps and young bears, which he afterwards
tames and uses to kill the serpent, who has shut up his dog in a cavern,
and carried off his sister; he forces the entrance of the place where
the dog is hidden, by striking the bolt of the door with three small
branches of the apple-tree; the bolt breaks into pieces, the door bursts
open, and the dog is delivered; dog, wolf, and young bear then worry the
serpent, and Ivan liberates the Princess Mary. [356] the young Mary, being persecuted,
is miraculously assisted by a cow. An old woman has three daughters of
her own (of whom one has one eye, another two, and the third three), and
a step-daughter called Mary; her own three do nothing, and eat much; the
step-daughter must work hard and eat little. Her step-mother gives her
for one night alone, while she takes the cow to pasture, to spin, make
into skeins, weave, and bleach, the weight of five pounds. The maiden
goes to the pasture-ground, embraces her variegated cow, leans on her
neck and bewails her fate. The cow says to her, "Beautiful girl, enter
one of my

ears, and come out by the other, and all will be done."–In the Italian
variety of this story,

[357] the cow spins with her horns for
the good maiden, whilst she combs the head of the old woman or the
Madonna. I think I have already said that I recognise in this good old
woman, fairy, or Madonna, the moon. The moon, like the sun, is
considered as in relation with the aurora, and especially the evening
aurora, which she accompanies; she is the hostess, the guide, and the
protectress of the hero and heroine of evening, lost and pursued in the
night; after the evening aurora, the white moon comes out, in the same
way as after the morning aurora the sun comes out in effulgence. We have
seen that the name of purifier, cleanser, is given to the Vedic aurora;
from this expression to the image of comber or cleanser of the head of
the old Madonna the transition is easy;

[358] from,

the
careful combing of her hair of Italian tradition, are one and the same
thing. In the thirty-fifth story of the fifth book of

[359] what the cow does with Mary, and
in the morning tells everything to her mother, who gives orders that
the

cow
be killed. Mary warns the cow; and the cow recommends her to eat none of
her flesh, to keep the bones, sow them in the garden, and water them. The maiden does so; every day, however hungry she may be, she eats none
of the meat, only collects the bones together. From the bones sown in
the garden arises a marvellous apple-tree, with leaves of gold, and
branches of silver, which prick and wound the three daughters of the
stepmother, whilst, on the other hand, they offer apples to the
beautiful maiden, in order that she may present one to the young and
rich lord who is to make her his wife. In the following story, the
fifty-fifth, which is a variation of the preceding one, the girl is
named Mary, and her husband Ivan TzareviÄ; when she goes to the pasture,
and when she returns, she is accustomed to make obeisance to the right
foot of the cow. When the cow, being killed, revives again in the shape
of a tree, it swarms with birds, which sing songs for kings and peasants
alike, and make the sweet fruits fall upon Mary's plate. The apples that cause horns to grow, and those which beautify and
make young, mentioned in the thirty-sixth story of the fifth book, and
again in the last book of the collection of Afanassieff, as
well as in other European variations of the same subject, are connected,
in my opinion, with the myth of the evening sky, and of the lunar night,
in the shape of an apple-tree. In the fifteenth story of the collection
of Erlenwein, the third brother, the usual Ivan, comes to an
apple-tree which has red apples, and eats four of them, upon which four
horns grow on his head, to such a height that he cannot enter the
forest; he goes to an apple-tree that bears white fruit, eats four
apples, and the four horns disappear. (The solar hero at evening
approaches the tree with the red apples, the evening aurora, and
immediately
becomes deformed; horns grow on his head; he loses himself in the shades
of night; in the moonlight and the alba, he approaches the tree with the
white apples, loses his horns, and becomes young and beautiful
again.)

In the fifty-seventh story of the sixth book of
Afanassieff's collection, Ivan TzareviÄ is presented with the
apples which restore youth to him who eats them, by the sister of the
sun, to whose abode he is lifted in the following manner: Ivan (the sun)
has for his sister (no doubt half-sister) a serpent-witch (night), who
has already devoured his father and mother (the sun and the aurora of
evening, which create the night, and are destroyed by it); the witch
persecutes her little brother Ivan, and endeavours to eat him; he flees,
and she overtakes him in the vicinity of the dwelling of the sister of
the sun (the aurora, the true sister of Ivan). The witch makes a
proposal to Ivan, that they be weighed together in the scales. Ivan
accepts this proposal, upon which the one enters the one scale, and the
other the other; no sooner does the witch put her foot on the scale
than, as she weighs so much more than Ivan, he is lifted up to heaven,
the dwelling of the sister of the sun, where he is welcomed and
admitted. (A beautiful myth, of which the meaning is evident. Ivan is
the sun, the aurora is his sister; at morning, near the abode of the
aurora, that is, in the east, the shades of night go underground, and
the sun arises to the heavens; this is the mythical pair of scales. Thus, in the Christian belief, St Michael weighs human souls: those who
weigh much sink down into hell, and those who are light arise to the
heavenly paradise.)

By means of the sister of the sun, Ivan saves himself from the witch. In another story in Afanassieff,[360] by
means of the sister of the hero Nikanore, the same Ivan, running after
the cows, causes them to have golden horns and tails, with sides formed
of stars; and afterwards, with the assistance of the hero Nikanore in
person (of the sun, that is, of himself), he kills the serpent. [361] we find the devil in the shape of
a bull, which bellows, and throws up the earth with its horns, arresting
a nuptial procession. From a bull he turns into a bear, then a hare, and
then a crow, to put obstacles in the way of the marriage, until, having
presented himself in the form of a devil, a soldier-hero blinds him
while he is drinking. A variation of this soldier is the third son of
the peasant,

[362] who is so strong that with a snap
of his fingers he makes the bull and the bear fall dead, and then by a
single pinch strips off their skins. The same hero hires himself to a
merchant, whom he engages to serve for two years, on condition of
receiving as his reward, at the end of them, the permission to give him
a snap with the fingers and a pinch. The merchant thinks he is getting
the man's service for nothing, but pays for it with his life. The
merchant seldom plays a good part in popular stories. He and the miser
are synonymous,–the miser is the monster which keeps treasures hidden;
and on this account, as we have already seen in the Vedic hymns
themselves, the enemies of the gods, the monsters that ravish and
conceal the treasures, are represented as paá¹ayas or merchants, cheats,
robbers, or misers. The currency of this epithet

as a
term of infamy must have been owing in part to the dislike with which
the priestly sacrificers of the last Vedic period regarded the
merchants, in whom they saw only a pack of misers, because, on account
of their wandering life, they had neither cows nor bulls to give them
for sacrifice, but carried with them all their fortune, and did not
require the fertilising rain of the god Indras to multiply their gold
and their silver. The celestial bull comes out of the night or the nocturnal stables
either, as we have seen, to help the hero, to be sacrificed, to flee
from persecution, or because he has been stolen by a skilful thief. In one of Kriloff's fables, God sends a terrible plague among the
animals, of which they perish in great numbers. They are so terrified by
it that they forsake their habits, and begin to wander aimlessly hither
and thither. The wolf no longer eats the sheep; the fox leaves the hens
unmolested; the turtle-doves no longer make love to each other. Then the
lion holds a council of the animals, and exhorts them all to confess
their faults. The cunning fox essays to quiet the lion-judge by assuring
him that though he stole some sheep, he did not thereby commit a fault;
and so he justifies his own ravages; as also do the bear, the tiger, the
wolf, and all the most wicked of the animals. Then the simple bull comes
forward, and, in his turn, confesses that he stole a little hay from the
priest. This crime appears so heinous that the council of animals
sentences the bull to be offered in sacrifice.[363]

Sometimes, on the contrary, the bull, either because he cannot bear
the bad treatment that he receives from his masters, or in order to
avoid the danger of being killed or sold by the stupid son, who is in
need of money that
he may marry a wife, a danger of which he has a presentiment, abandons
the stable with other animals, constructs a hut or isbÃ  and shuts
himself up in it.[364] He has with him the lamb, the
goose, the cock, or else some other tame animals. The fox passes by,
hears the crowing of the cock, and goes to call his friends the bear and
the wolf to help him. The bear opens the door, the fox enters, and the
bull by goring him with his horns, the lamb by butting against his
sides, and the cock by pecking his eyes out, put an end to the unwelcome
intruder. The wolf, who goes in, curious to see what is going on, has
the same fate, and the bear, who comes last, only succeeds with great
difficulty, and after having been severely maltreated, in effecting his
escape. In another variation of the same story, the bear dies of fear,
and the stupid son takes his skin, sells it and makes money; then, the
danger of being sold having passed by, the bull and his company return
home. The battle between the tame and the savage animals, won by the
former, is an expression in zoological form of the victory of the heroes
(the sun and the moon) over the monsters of darkness. The story of the hero-thief is generally connected with the carrying
off of his master's horse; but not unfrequently the hero, like the
monster, becomes a robber of cows and oxen. [365] is required to steal from his
master a black bull or ox tied to the plough; if he succeeds, he is to
have a hundred roubles for his reward; but if he does not, he is to
receive instead a hundred bastinadoes. In

order
to steal it, Ivan adopts the following device: he takes a cock, plucks
it, and puts it alive under a clod of earth. The ploughmen come with the
oxen; while they are ploughing, the cock starts up; they leave the
plough to run after it, upon which Ivan, who was hidden behind a bush,
comes out. He cuts off one ox's tail and puts it in another ox's mouth,
and then leads away the black ox. The ploughmen, not having been able to
overtake the cock, come back, and when they see only two animals instead
of three, conclude that one ox has eaten the black ox and is beginning
to eat the tail of the other, the variegated ox. In the twenty-first
story of the fifth book of

[366]

[367] In another story of

[368] With these two myths are connected
two more, that of the son of the cow and

that
of the ascent into heaven by means of the cow's hide. [369] instead of the cow we have the
bitch giving birth to the strongest of the three brothers. [370] In the nineteenth story of

the second story of the fifth book of

[371]

painful fall from the sky, we awaken alive, so the story does not say of
the hero who fell from heaven that he is dead, only that his dreams are
dead. He is only unlucky when, the second time, he attempts the descent
with a greater weight. While reasonings such as these may have helped to diffuse the myths,
I believe that the myths, at their formation, pleased more as images of
nature than of reason, and as the images of mythology are almost all
celestial, so in the third brother, or old man of other varieties of the
story, who mounts up to heaven and comes down again by means of the
cow's hide, I always recognise the sun. The old man who ascends into
heaven, after the cow is dead, does so also by means of a vegetable of
funereal omen which grows up in a marvellous manner. An old man and an old woman have one daughter; she eats some beans
and lets one fall to the ground; a plant (the moon) grows up till it
reaches the sky. The old man mounts up and then comes back again. He
tries to take his wife up in a sack, but unable to bear the weight, he
lets her fall to the ground, when she dies.[372]

A cabbage grows up near an old man's dwelling, till in like manner it
rises up to the sky. The old man climbs up, makes a hole in the sky, and
eats and drinks to satiety. He then returns and narrates everything to
his wife. She wishes to go up too; when they are half way, the old man
lets the sack drop, the old woman dies, and her husband prepares her
funeral, calling in the fox[373] as a mourner. Other variations of the same story offer us, instead of the
cow's hide, the cabbage, and the beanstalk, the pea-plant, and even the
oak-tree, which grows up to heaven.[374]

From the vegetable or funereal plant,–a symbol, as we have already
remarked, at once of abundance and resurrection,–by which the hero
ascends to heaven, where he finds riches and abundance of food, the
transition was very natural to the pea which turns round, of which the
hero Turn-little-Pea (the son of the king of the peas) is born. In the second story of the third book of Afanassieff,[375] Turn-little-Pea appears as the
third of the brothers, as the youngest brother, who delivers his sister
and his two brothers from the monster. But the ungrateful brothers
(perhaps covetous of the maiden, here called a sister, but, who is
virtually the same, the bride delivered and disputed for by the three
brothers in numerous Indo-European legends), tie him to an oak-tree and
go home alone. Turn-little-Pea unroots the whole oak and goes off. He
afterwards kills three more monster-serpents, and the she-serpents their
wives. In the thirtieth story of the second book of Afanassieff,
this enterprise against the serpents, male and female, is attributed to
the usual Ivan. He goes with his brothers against the serpent with
twelve heads, and with his iron stick alone kills nine of them, and the
three remaining ones by the help of his two brothers. Then the
she-serpent and her three daughters persecute the three brothers, and
Ivan
in particular. She causes them to find a beautiful cushion upon the
ground; Ivan, who is suspicious of some trick, first beats the cushion,
upon which blood gushes out of it (in the story of
Turn-little-Pea, the young hero averts the danger by making the
sign of the cross with his sword, when blood comes out). The serpent
then tempts them by an apple-tree with gold and silver apples. The
brothers wish to pluck some; Ivan, however, first strikes the tree, and
blood flows from it. They then come to a beautiful fountain, where the
brothers would like to drink; Ivan strikes the fountain, and again blood
comes from it. The cushion, the apple-tree, and the fountain were the
three daughters of the serpent. Then the serpent, having failed to
deceive them, rushes upon Ivan; the latter escapes with his brothers
into a forge shut by twelve iron gates; the serpent licks the doors with
her tongue to force a passage, and her tongue is caught with red-hot
pincers. In the fourth story of Erlenwein, the three brothers occur
again with interesting mythical names. A woman bears three sons; one at
evening, who is on this account called VeÄernik, or the evening one; the
second at midnight, whence he is named PolunoÄnik, or the midnight one;
the third at the aurora, who is named SvetazÃ³r, or the clearly-seeing. The three brothers become adults in a few hours. The most valiant of the
three is SvetazÃ³r, the last one. To prove his strength, he goes to the
blacksmith and orders an iron club that weighs twelve puds (480 pounds);
he throws it into the air and catches it on the palm of his hand, the
club breaks. He orders one of twenty puds (800 pounds), throws it up,
catches it on his knee, and it breaks. Finally he orders one of thirty
puds (1200 pounds), throws it up, and catches it on his forehead; it
bends but does
not break. SvetazÃ³r has it straightened and takes it with him, as he
goes with his two brothers to deliver the three daughters of the Tzar,
carried off by three magicians into the three castles of copper, silver,
and gold. SvetazÃ³r, after having drunk the water of strength, and
received from the first princess an egg of copper, from the second one
of silver, and from the third a golden one, delivers the three
princesses and brings them out. The two brothers, seeing that the third
princess is more beautiful than the others, think that the youngest
brother is reserving her for himself, and throw him into the water. SvetazÃ³r wanders about the subterranean world, and delivers the daughter
of another Tzar by killing a monster and burying him under a rock. A
soldier boasts before the Tzar of having accomplished this heroic act. SvetazÃ³r invites the soldier to prove his strength, and so the truth of
his boast, by lifting the rock up. He does not succeed, and SvetazÃ³r
wins the trial of strength, upon which the soldier is executed by order
of the Tzar. After this, SvetazÃ³r, for having once spared the life of a
crow, is carried by it into the world of the living, on condition that
he gives it something to eat by the way. SvetazÃ³r has at length to feed
the crow with his own flesh, yet is in the end set down again safe and
sound, with all his flesh, in the world above, where, with the eggs of
copper, silver, and gold, he causes the castles formed of these metals
to arise, in which are found the ring, the slipper, and the robe
demanded from their bridegrooms by the three princesses, who hoped by
this expedient to see again their lost SvetazÃ³r. Then SvetazÃ³r begins to
sweep out the terrace of the golden castle. The third princess expresses
her intention to take him for her husband. The nuptials are celebrated,
SvetazÃ³r pardoning his two elder brothers and giving them
the two elder sisters of his bride. (The princess of the copper is the
evening aurora, the princess of the silver is the silvery moon, and that
of the gold is the morning aurora, to whom SvetazÃ³r, the clearly-seeing,
the illumined, the sun, is married.)

In the sixth story of the first book of Afanassieff, the
same undertaking is accomplished by the third brother, Ivan. The monster
which carries off the three sisters is an aquatic one, an otter. Abandoned by his brothers in the nether world, Ivan is overtaken by a
great tempest; he takes pity upon some young birds that are bathing, and
saves them under his dress, upon which the grateful mother of the birds
brings him back to the upper world. In the fifteenth story of
Erlenwein, the third brother is the cunning one, who, by a
stratagem, and by means of his purse, which is self-replenishing, steals
from his two brothers the snuff-box out of which issue as many armies as
are wished for, and the cloth which makes the wearer invisible (both
figures to represent the cloud from which come forth riches, solar rays,
thunderbolts, and weapons, and which hides the hero, that is, renders
him invisible). In the fifty-fourth story of the fifth book of
Afanassieff, Ivan of the dog, the hero sacrificed by his
brothers, is the strong one, he who delivers the three princesses, who
possesses the three rings, and gives them to the goldsmith from whom
they were ordered, and who is not able to make them, by which means he
is recognised. Ivan TzareviÄ, inasmuch as he was born of a cow, as we have also seen
above, was necessarily represented as a bull; the bull displays part of
his strength by drinking; Ivan TzareviÄ drinks, at a gulp, whole barrels
of wine of marvellous strength. In this capacity he resembles Indras,
the great drinker of somas, and the drinker BhÃ®mas, the second brother
of the PÃ¢á¹á¸avas. The third brother is now Prince Ivan (Ivan TzareviÄ, Ivan KarolieviÄ,
Ivan KralieviÄ), now the stupid Ivan (Ivan durak), Ivan the little fool
(Ivan DuraÄiok). But, as I have already remarked, the fool generally
makes his fortune, either because the kingdom of heaven is for the poor
in spirit, or because the stupidity of Ivan is feigned, or else because
the fool becomes wise. In a story given in Afanassieff,[376] the fool is also lazy, and takes
the name of Emilius. Emilius is sent with a barrel to draw water; he only goes on account
of the promise made him by his sister, that he will receive as a reward
a pair of red boots.–This desire of the boy-hero, and of the
girl-heroine, is spoken of in many popular songs, and among others, in a
Piedmontese one, as yet unpublished. In the seventeenth story of the
fifth book of Afanassieff,[377] the sister kills her brother,
Little John, to possess herself of his red strawberries (as in the
Esthonian tale), and his red little shoes. Upon his grave a fine cane
grows; a shepherd makes a flute of it, and the flute, pressed to the
lips, begins to emit the following lamentation:–

"Gently, gently, little shepherd, play;

Do not wound my heart! My little sister, the traitress,

For the red little strawberries, for the red
little shoes!"

[378] and her crime is thus discovered. These

little
red shoes are simply a variation of the slippers which are lost by the
fugitive aurora, and found again by the sun, and which both wish to
wear. (I refer to this myth the origin of the nuptial custom in Europe
of maidens, towards the new year, throwing the slipper to know whether,
during the next year, they will be married, and who is to be their
husband.)

[379] The slipper lost by the maiden,
Little Mary (Masha, the Marion of Piedmontese and French legends), and
found by the prince, also occurs in the Russian tales. In the thirtieth
of the sixth book of

legend of Queen Berta is one of the most popular examples. The Russian
Little Mary, like Cinderella, is at first of ugly aspect, and then
beautiful. In the Russian story, the maiden becomes beautiful by
mounting upon the stove. SÃ®tÃ¢ comes forth, beautiful in her innocence,
passing through the fire; the morning aurora only seems beautiful when
it passes through the flames of the Eastern sky. The stove brings us
back to the interrupted story of the foolish and lazy Emilius (or
Ivan).–On account, therefore, of the promise made to him of the red
boots, he goes to the fountain with the barrel to draw water. In the
fountain he catches a pike, who beseeches him to set him at liberty, and
promises in return to make him fortunate. Being lazy, the greatest
favour that he wishes for at this moment is that he may be helped to
carry the barrel; the grateful pike performs the miracle of the barrel
full of water which walks of its own accord. (I have already endeavoured
to explain this myth: the cloud is represented as a barrel in the Vedic
hymns; it moves on of its own accord; the barrel does the same; the
hero, as long as he is shut up in the cloud, remains foolish; the barrel
of the fool walks of itself.) Emilius is then sent to cut wood; by
favour of the grateful pike, it is enough for him to send his hatchet,
which cuts the wood of itself; the wood piles itself upon the waggon,
and the waggon, without being drawn by any one, advances, passing or
crushing whatever it meets; they endeavour to arrest its progress, when
the trunk of an oak-tree detaches itself from the waggon, and, like a
stick, beating on every side, sweeps the road (these are all curious
variations of the walking forest or cloud). The Tzar then sends to
invite him to court, and knowing his weak penchant for things of a red
colour, he promises him a red robe, a red hat, and red boots. When
the

Tzar's envoys arrive, Emilius, like his

[380]

The fool Ivan takes his good luck from the living, but he also does
so from the dead. On account of having watched three nights by the tomb
of his father, his luck begins,[381] the shade of his father having
blessed him; but, as the dead bring good luck (a belief which, at any
rate, has always been entertained by the heirs of rich men deceased),
the third brother speculates on the body of his own mother. We do not
know whether he does so out of
pure simplicity, or with some hidden and far-seeing design, presumable
from the ease with which he exchanges the character of a fool for that
of a cunning schemer (the first Brutus of popular tradition). In the
seventeenth story of Erlenwein, after he has carried a treasure
home, by selling his ox to the tree, and then cutting down the tree,
which contains money, he always guards his money, and sleeps upon it. His brothers know this, and resolve to go and kill him. But that very
night, the third, the foolish brother, leaves his mother in charge of
the treasure; the brothers come and kill his mother by mistake, instead
of him. He turns up, and threatens to give them up to justice; they
bribe him with a hundred roubles to keep silence. Then the third brother
takes his mother's body and carries it into the middle of the road, in
order that a merchant's waggon may crush it; when this happens, he
accuses the merchant of murder, until the latter gives him a hundred
more roubles to say nothing about it. He then comes to a village by
night with his mother's corpse; he places it against a peasant's door,
and knocks at the window; the peasant opens the door, the body falls,
and the peasant treads upon it, upon which the so-called stupid son
cries out that he has killed his mother, and receives another hundred
roubles, on promise of silence. Then the two elder brothers, finding
that it is possible to speculate upon corpses, and make one's fortune,
kill their wives, and go to town with their bodies; they are immediately
arrested and put into prison. The law of atavism evolves itself in the generation of the heroes of
mythical legends, no less than in that of simple mortals upon earth. Of
a stupid father is born a wise son, and then the wise son in turn has a
foolish one. I do not as yet know how to explain this singular fact of
natural history; its appearance in mythology, however, is
not difficult to understand. To the luminous day succeeds the gloomy
night, and then again to the dark night the luminous day; to summer
succeeds winter, and to winter summer; to white black, and to black
white; to heat cold, and to cold heat. On this account, in legends, when the mother is intelligent, the son,
generally speaking, is silly; whereas, when the mother is silly,[382] the son is usually
intelligent. In the fifth story of the sixth book of Afanassieff, a
soldier enters the house of a woman, while her son is travelling, and
induces her to believe that he has just returned from hell, where he had
seen her son employed in taking the storks to pasture, and greatly in
want of money; the soldier says that he is about to return to hell, and
will be happy to take with him whatever the woman wishes to send to her
son. The credulous woman gives him some money, directing him to take it
immediately to hell, and give it to her poor child. The soldier
disappears, and shortly afterwards the woman's son returns home; his
mother is greatly astonished at his appearance, and tells him how she
has been deceived; he gets angry and leaves the house again, swearing
never to return till he finds some one more foolish than his mother. He
is a skilful thief; he steals from a lady, whilst her husband is absent,
a hog with its little pigs, and puts them in safe concealment; the
husband returns, hears what has taken place, and follows the thief with
a carriage and horses. The robber hears him coming; squats down on the
ground, takes off his hat, and pretends to be covering with
it a bird or a falcon, which wishes to escape. The husband comes and
asks him if he has seen the robber; the latter answers that he has seen
him, but that he is a long way off, and that the roads by which he can
be overtaken are many and winding. The husband, who, perhaps, does not
know the proverb which says, "Who wishes, let him go; who wishes not,
let him send," asks the robber to overtake the fugitive; the thief
demurs, saying that he has under his hat a falcon, which cost his master
three hundred roubles, and that it may escape. The gentleman promises to
take care of it, and if the falcon escapes, to pay the three hundred
roubles. The thief does not believe his promise, and desires the three
hundred roubles in pledge of his good faith; the gentleman gives them,
and the thief goes off with the carriage, the horses, and the three
hundred roubles. The gentleman stays till evening looking at the hat,
waiting for his friend to return; at last he loses patience, wants to
see what there is under the hat, and finds nothing–but a proof of his
own stupidity.[383]

merchant, and now of a peasant; the merchants wished, no less than the
peasants, to appropriate to themselves the most popular hero of
tradition. In the forty-sixth story of the fifth book of

[384] the fearless hero Giovannino,
after having confronted every kind of danger, dies from the terror the
sight of his own shadow inspires him with. In the same way, in the

[385]

[386] 2d, Baldak, son of Boris, the boy
seven years old, who succeeds in spitting in the Sultan's face–(I have
already remarked, in the preface to this work, that the king of the
Turks is, in the Slavonic tradition, as well as in that of Persia, the
representative of the devil; the demon, when the hero

approaches,
smells the odour of human flesh in India, of Christian flesh in Western
stories,

[387] and of Russian flesh in Russian
fairy tales)–but who afterwards becomes the Sultan's prisoner, because
he appears to the third daughter of the latter with a star under his
heel, or shows his heel (which is the vulnerable part of both hero and
monster); 3d, Basil Bes-Äiastnoi, who goes, by his father-in-law's
order, into the kingdom of the serpent, in order to receive a gift from
him, with adventures similar to those of the young PlavaÄek in Bohemian
stories, when he goes to seek the three golden hairs of the old Vsieveda
(the all-seeing, the Vedic sun ViÃ§vavedas);

[388] 4th, The third brother who
exchanges two sacks of flies and gnats he has caught for good
cattle. [389] The same hero takes the name of
Little Thomas Berennikoff; being blind of one eye, he kills an army of
flies, and boasts of having killed an army of heroes; he thus
dishonestly gains the reputation of being a hero, and is fortunate in
having an opportunity offered him of proving his bravery by killing a
monster-serpent, who, out of foolhardiness, shuts both eyes when he sees
that Thomas has but one; he afterwards destroys an army of Chinese with
the trunk of a tree, rooted up by his indomitable horse, which a real
hero had bound to the tree;

[390] 5th, The cunning rogue, Little
Thomas (Thomka; the quacks in Piedmont are accustomed to give the name
of Tommasino to the little devil which they conjure out

of a
phial), who, by means of disguises, cheats and robs the priest;

[391] 6th, The third brother who does
not suffer himself to be put to sleep by the witch (as we have seen
above the third sister who keeps one of her three eyes open);

[392] 7th, The famous robber,
Klimka,

[393] who, by means of a drum (in Indian
tales a trumpet), terrifies his accomplices, the robbers, and takes
their money, and then steals from a gentleman his horse, his casket of
jewels, and even his wife; 8th, The Cossack who delivers the maiden from
the flames, and carries her to his golden house, where there are two
other maidens (be it understood, the one in the silver house, and the
other in that of copper); from which three maidens the Cossack receives
a shirt which renders him invulnerable, a sword which produces the most
marvellous effects in slaughtering men, and a purse which, when shaken,
drops money;

[394] 9th, The celebrated Ilia Muromietz
(Elias of Murom), round whom, as also around SvetazÃ³r and Svyatogor
(holy mount), Dobrynia NikitiÄ, and the heroes of Vladimir, is grouped
an entire heroic Russian epic poem. [395]

Other
variations of the same hero are the son of the merchant given up to be
educated by the devil, who teaches him every kind of craft; the boy
Basil, who understands the language of birds, and who makes his parents
serve him;

[396] the merchant or son of a
peasant,

[397] who, because he prefers good
advice to money, acquires a fortune; the virtuous workman, who receives
by way of pay for his labour only three kapeika, which, spent in good
works, enables him at last to marry the king's daughter, or the princess
who did not laugh. [398]

[399] the third brother, thought to be
foolish, is ill-treated by his parents, who dress and feed him badly. The king issues a proclamation, that whoever can make a flying vessel
will obtain his daughter to wife. The mother sends forth her three sons
in quest of the necessary enchantment; to her third son she gives a
little brown bread and water, whilst the two eldest go provided with
good white loaves and some brandy. The fool meets on the way a poor old
man, salutes him, and begins to share with him his scanty store of food;
the old man transmutes his brown bread into white, and his water into
brandy, and then advises him to enter the forest, to make the sign of
the cross upon the first tree he finds, and to strike it with his axe;
then to throw himself on the ground and stay there until he wakens; he
will see a vessel ready before him: "Sit down in it," added the old man,
"and fly whither your behest requires you; and by the way take up beside
you as

many
as you meet."

[400] This chariot is freighted with
abundance, both to eat and to drink; the young man overtakes several
needy beggars, and invites them up into the chariot; he receives only
poor people, not a single rich man. [401] But these poor men afterwards show
their gratitude to the hero, and help him in other adventures imposed
upon him by the Tzar, who hopes by this means to get rid of a son-in-law
of such vulgar origin. One of the new tasks imposed requires him to eat
twelve oxen, and to drink at one gulp forty barrels of wine; in this he
is helped by Eating (AbiÃ©dalo) and by Drinking (ApivÃ¡lo), whom he had
entertained in his chariot-ship, and who eat and drink instead of
him. [402] At last he comes to claim and
marry the young princess. (The hero-sun, taken up into the chariot of
the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, by the grace of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, invoked by him in danger, is
delivered, and espouses the aurora.)

[403] In the Vedic hymns it is now the
aurora, the beautiful maiden, who delivers the hero-sun, and now the
hero-sun who delivers the beautiful maiden, the aurora. In
the forty-first story of the sixth book of

[404] She too, like the aurora, knows
all; she too protects the poor against the rich, and the innocent
against the guilty. The dwarf Allwis is a form of this child. Allwis is
the omniscient man of the Edda, who solves all the questions put to him
by the god Thor, in order to obtain his daughter; when he is done with
answering these questions, day breaks, and the sun shines. [405] In a

variation
of this story,

[406] the girl is persecuted, not by her
father, but the well-known cruel stepmother, for whom she divides the
wheat from the barley, and draws water at the fountain (like the Vedic
maiden ApalÃ¢); she goes three times splendidly dressed to church (which
takes the place of the ball-room of other stories), where she is seen
three times by a handsome prince; she is twice followed, and twice
disappears; the third time the prince has gum (pitch, in other
variations) put on the ground; the fugitive loses her golden slipper in
consequence, which the prince picks up, and tries on all the maidens
till he finds his bride. In another story,

[407] where the relation of the aurora
with the two AÃ§vinÃ¢u comes out in wonderful distinctness,

[408] it is by means of her marvellous
speaking puppet (

[409] The maiden alone, by the help of
her puppet, succeeds; the Tzar wishes to see the girl who prepared his
extraordinary shirt, and goes to find her; he is astonished at her
beauty, and marries her. In the

The
same girl (the aurora) whom we have here only as a good, beautiful,
intelligent, and skilful maiden, appears in other stories given in

[410] and his guide through the world;
and when the boy, by the incantation of a witch, is transformed into a
lamb or kid (in a story of the Canavese, in Piedmont, the seven monks,
brothers of the courageous girl, are transformed into seven hogs), she
recommends him to the care of the prince, her husband, in order that he
may destroy the evil work of the witch. The same maiden is found again
as the very wise Basilia (Vasilisa Premudraia), who succours the young
hero, because, after stealing her dress while she was bathing in the
sea, he restores it to her, agreeably to her prayer. For this favour she
gratefully accomplishes for him the labours imposed upon him by the king
of the waters, and ends, after many vicissitudes, by marrying him. [411] She appears once more as the royal
maiden (Tzar-dievitza), who comes three times with her ships by sea to
lead away the young Ivan, beloved by her;

[412] and I also place among the
girl-heroines the daughter of the shepherd in the twenty-ninth story of
the fifth book of

returning
from the chase (the solar hero always meets the aurora, his bride, when
returning from the hunt in the forest of night), he meets a shepherd's
daughter, who is leading out the flock to pasture, so beautiful that her
like would be sought for in vain over the world. He becomes enamoured of
her, and promises to make her his wife, but only on condition that she
will never say anything displeasing to him, whatever he may do; the poor
enamoured maiden consents, the nuptials are celebrated, and the couple
live together happily for a year. A boy is born to them; then the king
says roughly to his wife that the boy must be killed, that it may never
be said the heir to the throne is the son of a shepherdess. The poor
woman resigns herself to her fate, remarking, "The will of the king must
be done." Another year passes, and a daughter is born. The king informs
his wife that she too must be killed, as she can never become a
princess, but will always remain a peasant girl. The unhappy mother once
more bows her head to the will of the king, who, however, consigns his
son and daughter, not to an executioner, but to his sister, that they
may receive all the attentions due to their royal pedigree and standing. Years pass away; the little prince and princess grow up beautiful,
healthy, good, and happy, and pass adolescence. Then the king puts his
wife to the last proof. He sends her back to her house in the dress of a
shepherdess, signifying at the same time that she has lived with him
long enough. Then he orders her to return, to put the rooms in order,
and to wait upon the new bride whom he intends to take her place; the
shepherd's daughter obeys again without a murmur. The new bride arrives,
and is set down at the table; they eat, drink, and are merry; the
shepherd's daughter is obliged to see and hear all, and to serve in
silence; at last the king asks her, "Well,

is
not my bride beautiful?" To which the unhappy woman responds with a
heroic effort, "If she seem beautiful to thee, still more does she seem
so to me." Then the king, at the summit of his felicity, exclaims,
"Dress thyself again in thy royal robes, and place thyself by my side;
thou hast been, and shalt always be, my wife, my only wife; this, my
supposed bride, is thy daughter, and this handsome youth is thy son."
The poor heroine had undergone the last proof of her virtue, and
triumphed. But the virtue of the legendary heroine is not always so sound. Often
the good wife, sister, maiden, or woman is corrupted by contact with the
wicked. We have already seen how the beautiful aurora, the pitying and
beneficent maiden, becomes, in the Vedic hymns themselves, the
evil-doer, whom the god Indras overthrows and destroys. The Hellenic
Amazons, the beautiful and proud warrior-women, were also pursued,
fought with, and vanquished by the Hellenic heroes. Thus the
Scandinavian warrior, Walkiries, has a double aspect, a good and a bad. The Russian stories also supply numerous instances of the ease with
which the good degenerates into the demon, the hero into the monster,
and the beautiful heroine into the powerful and mischief-working
witch. This good sister Helen or Little Helen, so careful a guardian of her
brother John, ends, when she conceives a passion for the monster, with
becoming his perfidious persecutor. (The evening aurora is represented
as a friend of the monster of night, who conspires with him against her
brother the sun; and whoever observes the sinister aspect often assumed
by the reddish sky of evening, will find this fiction a very natural
one. I have said above that a Piedmontese proverb predicts bad weather
for the morrow from a red evening; but in
Piedmont the belief is also widely diffused that the red of evening
signifies blood, and that this bloody redness signifies war. It
certainly does mean war, but a mythical war–the war in which the hero,
fighting against the monster, succumbs and sheds blood. It is a woman
that is the hero's destruction. A counter-type of the biblical Delilah
is found in all the popular Indo-European traditions; the Vedic aurora,
the sister of RÃ¢vaá¹as in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am, the sister of Hidimbas
in the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, the Hellenic Dejanira, Ariadne, Medea, the
Amazons, Helen, the Slavonic Helen, and Anna the Sabine woman, the
Scandinavian Walkiries, Freya, Idun, BrÃ¼nhilt, Gudrun, the Germanic
KrÃ®mhilt, are all forms of one and the same heroine, conceived now in
the light of a saint, and now in that of a witch. [413] after the bull has saved from the
bear the fugitive brother and sister, Ivan TzareviÄ and Helen the
exceedingly beautiful (PrekraÃ§na), they enter a brigand's house. Their
bull, having become a dwarf, kills all the brigands, and shuts their
bodies up in a room, which he forbids Helen to enter; the latter, not
attending to the prohibition, enters, and seeing the head of the brigand
chief, falls in love with him, resuscitates him by means of the water of
life, and then conspires with him to destroy her brother Ivan, by
requiring him to accomplish enterprises in which death seemed
inevitable, or else by ordering him to bring her, first, the milk of a
wolf, then that of a she-bear, and then that of a lioness. Ivan, by the
help of his dwarf (or the sun grown small during the night, and perhaps
also the moon), accomplishes all these undertakings. We have already
seen how white comes from black; the milk of the wolf, the bear,
and

the
lioness is the

[414]) Ivan goes back to his sister
without the eggs, upon which she threatens to burn him in the bath. Ivan, with the help of the wolf's, the bear's, and the lion's whelps, or
Ivan, with the young wolf, bear, or lion (the moon), or Ivan the son of
the wolf, Ivan the son of the bear, Ivan the son of the lion (Ivan born
of the she-wolf Night, the she-bear Night, or the lioness Night), tears
the brigand to pieces, and binds his sister (as the Vedic cow) to a tree
(the aurora almost always loses herself in a tree or the water). Then
Ivan wishes to marry a heroine. [Two myths are here united in the story,
originating in one and the same phenomenon, which seems twofold, because
observed at different, almost literally succeeding, instants. The
morning sun comes and puts to flight his sister the aurora, driving her
back into the forest of night, and binding her to the tree; the morning
sun passes safe and sound through the flames (like SÃ®frit in the

of
strength of the god Thor, the shirt of Nessus). At last, however,
towards morning, Ivan vanquishes, subdues, and throws down (like SÃ®frit
in the

The same story of Ivan's perfidious sister, of which the mythical
sense appears to me more than usually evident, occurs again in other
forms in Russian tales. Whilst Ivan is travelling with his sister towards the kingdom where
all the people die[415] (that is, towards the night), a
fairy gives him a towel, by shaking which a bridge may be thrown across
a river–(is this bridge the milky way, the bridge or road to be taken by
the souls in
the Persian and Porphyrian belief, as well as in the German?)–but
advises him never to let his sister see him shake it. Ivan arrives with
his sister in the kingdom of the dead; they come upon a river on the
further bank of which there is a serpent, who has the power of
transforming himself into a handsome youth; Ivan's sister becomes
enamoured of him, and he induces her to steal the towel from her brother
and shake it. The sister, under the pretext of washing the dirty linen,
takes off the fairy's towel and shakes it; a bridge rises, upon which
the serpent crosses the river, and then conspires with the girl with
intent to work Ivan's ruin. They demand the usual milk, which Ivan
brings; then the flour which is shut up within twelve doors. Ivan goes
thither with his beasts of prey, takes the flour and brings it away, but
his beasts remain shut up inside; then his strength diminishes, and the
serpent, boasting that he fears him no longer, prepares to devour him. Ivan, by the advice of a crow, prays for time, and procrastinates till
his beasts of prey, gnawing the twelve doors through, come to his help,
and tear the serpent in pieces. The serpent's bones are burned in the
fire, its ashes are dispersed to the four winds, and the sister is bound
to a stone pillar (to the rock or mountain upon which the aurora arises,
fading away afterwards when the sun appears). Ivan places near her some
hay and a vessel full of water, that she may have whereof to eat and
drink, and another empty vessel, which she is to fill with her tears:
when she has eaten the hay, drunk the water, and filled the vessel with
her tears, it will be a sign that God has forgiven her; when Ivan too
will forgive her. Meanwhile, Ivan goes into a kingdom where there is
nothing but mourning, because a twelve-headed serpent is massacring all
the people (the usual nocturnal sky, where it is now the hero-sun,
now the
heroine aurora that sacrifices itself), and the king's daughter is the
next victim. Ivan, by the help of his hunting animals, cuts the serpent
to pieces, and then goes to sleep on the knees of the king's daughter. While he sleeps, a water-carrier passes towards morning, cuts off his
head, and presents himself to the king as the deliverer of the princess,
whom he demands for his wife. The beasts of prey come up, descry the
crow upon Ivan's corpse, and prepare to eat it, when the crow begs for
its life; they consent, and in return require it to search for the water
of life and death, by means of which Ivan is resuscitated; the
water-carrier's deceit is found out, and Ivan marries the princess whom
he had delivered from the monster. Then he goes to look for his sister,
and finds she has eaten the hay, drunk the water, and filled half the
vessel with tears; upon this he pardons her, and takes her away with
him. In another story,[416] instead of the perfidious sister,
we have the perfidious mother (probably step-mother), who, to please her
demon lover, feigns illness, and demands from Ivan the heart, first of
the three-headed, then of the six-headed, and finally of the
twelve-headed monster. Ivan accomplishes these undertakings. He is then
sent to a hot bath, to weaken his strength. Ivan goes, and his head is
cut off by the monster. But Ivan's two sons resuscitate him by rubbing a
root upon his body; the demon lover of Ivan's mother dies as soon as the
hero revives again. In the two sons of Ivan we recognise again the myth
of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u, the celestial physicians who resuscitate the solar
hero. In another story, Ivan KarolieviÄ (king's son) is threatened with
death by his own wife,[417] who, feigning illness, demands
the usual milk of a she-wolf, a she-bear, and a lioness, and then the
enchanted powder (powder of gold or flour), which is under the devils
mill, barred behind twelve doors. Ivan comes out, but his beasts remain
inside. He returns and finds his wife with the serpent, the son of the
serpent; he chaunts the song of death–he sings it three times;[418] on hearing which the serpent is
thrown down, and the beasts, regaining strength to deliver themselves,
come out and tear the serpent, and with him the perfidious wife is put
to death. [419] in which, by the help of his
tutor, Katoma, Ivan is victorious, so that Anna falls into his hands. But, understanding that Ivan's strength is not in himself, but his
tutor, she induces Ivan to send him away, after depriving him of his
feet. Anna then sends Ivan to take the cows to pasture. The lame Katoma
finds in the forest a blind man, also made so by Anna;

[420] they become friends and consociate
together, and carry off a beautiful maiden to be their sister; but a
witch comes and makes the maiden comb her hair, whilst she sucks her

breast
(we must remember that in the Indian story the girl has three breasts,
or is defective in her breast, in the same way as the witch makes the
Russian girl so by sucking her breast). The poor girl grows thin and
ugly, until the old witch is surprised in her evil doings by the two
heroes, fallen upon by them like a mountain of stone, and pressed so
tightly that she cries for mercy. Then they demand to be shown where the
fountain of life and healing can be found. The old woman conducts them
into a dense forest, and shows them a fountain. They first throw a dry
twig in, which immediately takes fire; they threaten to kill the old
witch, and force her to lead them to another fountain, into which they
throw another dry twig; it becomes green again. Then one rubs his eyes,
and the other his feet, with the water, and both become healthy and
strong again. They throw the witch into the fountain of fire. Katoma, in
a shepherd's dress, goes to deliver the hero Ivan from the demon cow,
which lifts up its tail and gives him back his strength and splendour. This is again the Vedic myth of the AÃ§vinÃ¢u united to the aurora, who
cure the blind and the lame,

Finally, such as we have found the blind girl in the Vedic hymns, so
we meet her again in Russian tradition.[421] A servant-maid takes out the eyes
of the maiden her mistress, after having put her to sleep by means of a
herb, and marries the king in her stead. The girl awakens, hears but
does not see; an old shepherd receives her into his house; during the
night she, although blind, sews a crown for the Tzar and sends the old
man to court to sell it for an eye (this is a variation of Queen Berta
in the forest). The servant-maid, now
become queen, tempted by the beauty of this crown, takes one of the
girls eyes out of her pocket and gives it to the old man. The maiden
arises at the aurora, washes her eye in her own saliva (i.e.,
the dew. In Tuscany, the peasants believe that whoever washes his face
in the dew before the sun rises on St John's Day, will have no illness
all the year following), puts it in the socket and sees. She then sews
another crown, and, in the same manner, recovers her other eye at the
next aurora. Then the servant-queen learns that she is alive, and makes
hired murderers cut her to pieces. Where the maiden is buried, a garden
arises and a boy shows himself. The boy goes to the palace and runs
after the queen, making such a din that she is obliged, in order to
silence him, to give him the girl's heart, which she had kept hidden. The boy then runs off contented; the king follows him, and finds himself
before the resuscitated maiden. He marries her, and the servant-girl is
blinded, and then torn to pieces by being fastened to the tails of
horses. Like the German GeneviÃ¨ve and the Hindoo ÃakuntalÃ¢, the Russian
wife is recognised by her husband by means of a boy. This is the young
sun, who enables the old one to be born again, to arise again and be
young once more; this is the son who, in the Hindoo legend, gives his
father his eyesight back, and by doing so, naturally imparts to him the
means of recognising his wife, whom he had forgotten, or rejected, or
lost, according to the various forms assumed by the celestial myth of
the separation of husband and wife. I might now carry on this comparison by entering the mythical field
of the more Western Slavonic nations;[422] but
it is not my intention to convert this modest volume into an entire
library of legends; neither is it necessary for my purpose, as by so
doing I should not add much more evidence to that which I have thus far
attempted to collect, in order to prove how zoological mythology is the
same in existing Slavonic tradition as it was in Hindoo antiquity. I
have, moreover, gone rather minutely into the contents of Russian
tradition in particular, because, on account of our ignorance of the
language, which is beautiful and worthy of study, it is little known,
and because it is of especial importance in our present inquiry. I
believe, if I do not deceive myself, that I have, up to this point,
given an account of all the more essential legends developed in the
Eastern Aryan world relating to the myth of the cow and the bull; and
now, in moving towards the West, I think I may venture to proceed with
greater expedition, because we shall find ourselves in a region already
familiar to us. It seemed to me that it was especially necessary, for a
just comparison, to determine and fix the character of Oriental
tradition, in order that it may be easy for the student to classify the
interminable stories and traditions which have already been collected in
Western Europe, and which are published in languages which are,
certainly, different from each other, but all, comparatively speaking,
readily accessible. If I have succeeded in imparting to the reader an
understanding of the more authentic sources of legendary traditions and
their most probable meanings, I shall go on with more courage and a
greater confidence to the investigations that follow. SECTION V. The Bull and the Cow in the

and Franco-Celtic traditions, as traditions which, in the Middle Ages
especially, had a close and continual correlation of correspondence with
each other. [423] In which, it is obvious we have
again the Vedic bull with a thousand horns

which comes out of the sea, and the bull which carries off the maiden. The bull which comes out of the sea is also found in Irish legends, and
in German ones. According to a German legend, of which several
variations exist, a shepherd received a dinner every day and a clean
shirt every Sunday from a variegated bull that came out of the sea. [424] A bull on the seaside begets, by
the sleeping queen, the king Meroveus, the first of the Merovingians;
perhaps it is on this account that we find a golden bull's head
represented on the tomb of King Childeric. Charles Simrock

[425] found a similar legend also in
Spain. The bull which carries the girl, which we have already met with
in the Russian stories, occurs again in the Norse tale

[426] of "

engages
to deliver her, and offers, if she so wills, to carry her away."

and
the thunderbolt of the god, penetrating the cloud, takes the form of a
phallos. Afterwards, as a symbol of the rod-phallos, the branch or rod
of the tree palÃ¢Ã§as was adopted, with which the cow was struck to make
it fruitful; such a magic rod is used in Germany to this day, where it
is in many parts the custom to strike the cow, in the belief that it
will render her fruitful. [427]

It is with the head of the most beautiful of the giant Hymir's oxen
fastened to his hook that, in Snorri's Edda, the god Thor goes
to fish up the immense serpent of Midgard from the bottom of the sea,
and destroys it upon the sea-shore. (This myth, if I am not mistaken,
has the following meaning:–The head of the solar, or lunar, bull is
devoured by the monster of night; this same head, tossed about, draws
up, towards morning as sun, and towards evening as moon, upon the shore
of the sea of night, that is to say, on the eastern mountain, the
monster-serpent: thus Hanumant, in the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am, passes over
to the opposite shore of the sea, crossing the body of the marine
monster, which he causes to burst; thus Indras kills Ahis the serpent
upon the mountain). Nor is there the cow of abundance only. Scandinavian tradition, in
the short poem on the dwarf Allwis, offers us the cornucopia in the cup
formed of the defence of oxen (i.e., with their horns), in
which the god Thor drinks hydromel. Thus Sigurd offers to BrÃ¼nhilt a
horn full
of mead to drink. And this horn, moreover, besides serving as a
cornucopia, becomes as a golden horn the war-trumpet of Odin (the
Giallarhorn). [428] also takes the name of Hornboge,
and, as such, assists the greatest hero, Thidrek or DÃ®trich, and is the
parent of the celebrated hero Sigurd (SÃ®frit, or Siegfried). And, in
conclusion, the horns are considered such an important weapon of the cow
and bull, that a proverb, which is at once Slavonic, German, and
Italian, says, "To a wicked cow, God gives short horns" (that it may do
no harm,

or
rather, because it wears them away by use); to cut off the cow's horns
means, in a German proverb, to surmount a difficulty; and to take the
bull or cow by the horns, is to disarm them. [429]

In the Greenland poem on Atli, in the Edda of SÃ¶mund, HÃ¶gni
says, that when many cattle are killed much blood is seen, and that when
one dreams of eagles, oxen are not far distant. In the Edda of
Snorri, whilst Odin, Loki, and HÃ¶nir are cooking an ox under a tree, an
eagle on its summit prevents the meat from being cooked, till the heroes
consent to give him part of it. The heroes consent, but the eagle
carries off no less than the two thighs and the two shoulders of the ox. The eagle has in the Edda the same demoniacal and infernal
character that is in other traditions ascribed to the crow, the funereal
stork, and the vulture: it searches for oxen; and therefore to dream of
eagles is an intimation that an ox is near, in the same way as they say
the presence of a vulture is a sign of the proximity of a corpse. [430] makes a battle begin "as soon as a
red cow is led over a certain bridge." We remember the Russian story of
the girl who, by means of the magical towel of her brother, makes a
bridge arise over the river, over which the monster-serpent, in the form
of a handsome young man, crosses to take her; how the brother is
sacrificed in the battle which he is obliged to fight against the
monster, who disarms him by fraud; and how the battle between the hero
and the monster begins when the maiden, passing the bridge, abandons the
hero, her brother, who falls and sheds his blood in the unequal
struggle. I have

already
remarked that in the popular belief the bloody sun of evening forebodes
war, and the red cow of German tradition represents no other than this
sky. As to the bridge, an interesting note of Kuhn and Schwartz

[431] seems to confirm the hypothesis
which I have already hinted at in connection with the Slavonic story,

[432]–like that other which we have
already seen current in India, and met with again in Turanian tradition,
and which exists as a German, Slavonic, and Italian proverb, "Even the
black cow yields white milk"–(the black night which produces the alba or
white dawn of morning, and we might add, the silver moon and the milky
way). Since it seems to me, therefore, as I trust it also does to the
reader, that the maiden who crosses the bridge
in the Slavonic stories is, without doubt, the same as the red cow which
does the like in German legend, and if I have not been mistaken in
identifying the maiden who travels with her brother to the kingdom of
the dead with the evening aurora and the dying sun, I shall here adduce
a few other German proverbs, which may also be said to be universal in
European tradition, relating to the cow, all pointing to a similar
conclusion. They are as follows:–"Shutting the stable after the cow has
been stolen." "He who has lost a cow, and recovers her tail, has not
much, but he has more than nothing." "A cow's tail might reach heaven,
if it were only a long one."[434] "A cow does not know what her tail
is worth till she loses it." "To take the cow by her tail." "The black
cow has crushed him, or has got upon him." "A cow cannot overtake a
hare." "The cow has outrun the hare." "Not all who sound the horn hunt
the hare." "When the cows laugh." "As a blind cow can find a pea." "He
must be carried about in an old cow's hide." "If the cow-maid spins,
there will be little yarn." "The cow will learn to spin first."[435]

Meditating upon all these German proverbs, it is, it appears
to me, not difficult to recognise in them a reminiscence of ancient
myths with which we are already acquainted. When we reflect that almost
every proverb has passed into contradictory forms and varieties, and as
in these varieties we may trace the elements of the history of a great
number of strange proverbs, it does not seem rash to affirm that the
said history generally had, in like manner, its origin in a myth. Not to
wander from the subject in hand, that the same proverb is attributed to
different animals, not only by different nations, but in the oral
traditions of the same people, I must refer the reader to what I have
remarked in the preface to this volume concerning the contradiction
which exists between certain superstitious beliefs. The contradiction
between many proverbs, as also between many superstitions, compared with
each other, can only be reconciled by referring both back to the
battle-field of mythology, where an inconceivable number of myths arise,
and can only arise, out of contradictions; that is, out of contrasted
aspects which celestial phenomena present, even to the same observer,
still more so to different observers. The comparative history of
mythical proverbs is yet to be written, and perhaps it is not yet
possible to write it according to rigorous scientific method in all its
completeness. A preliminary study of the details is necessary to
understand a proverb as well as a popular custom, a superstitious
belief, a legend, or a myth; and this study will demand some labour; for
one proverb, completely illustrated, may involve the development of an
entire epical history. I shall not presume here to solve the enigma of
the above-quoted German proverbs, but only to indicate what seems to me
to be the way of arriving at their most probable solution. In the study
of a proverb, it is necessary to lay great stress upon
its intonation. Upon the different tones in which an ancient proverb was
originally pronounced, and afterwards repeated, passing from tongue to
tongue, and from people to people, depends a great part of the
alteration in the meaning even of the most interesting of the proverbs,
which are a patrimony we owe in common to Aryan tradition. A proverb,
for instance, began by being a simple affirmation, the simple expression
of a natural mythical image; with the lapse of time the expression
remained, and the myth was forgotten; the expression then appeared to
refer to a strange thing, and was accompanied, when pronounced, with a
doubtful mark of interrogation; it was now adopted in the denial of an
impossible thing, and became an instrument for satire. Thus many
proverbs which have become satirical, must have been originally nothing
more than mythical affirmative phrases. "To shut the stable after the cow has been stolen." In England,
instead of the cow, we have in the proverb a girl: "When your daughter
is stolen, shut Peppergate" (the name of a little gate of the city of
Chester, which it is said the mayor ordered to be shut when his daughter
had been carried off). The proverb is now used to stir up a laugh at the
expense of those who are at pains to guard their property after it has
been robbed; but it perhaps had not always the same meaning. We are
already familiar in Hindoo tradition with the hero who delivers the
beautiful maiden out of the enclosure, and have seen how she is scarcely
free, when she is led away by iniquitous brothers or companions, after
shutting up the legitimate proprietor of the cow or maiden in the cave
whence the cow or girl came forth; how the ravishing brothers shut the
door of the stable or cavern, after having carried off the maiden. The
hero imprisoned in
the stable, the hero shut up in the darkness of night, often assumed in
mythology the form of a fool. Hence from the idea of shutting the gate
of the stable upon the hero, by the ravishers of his cow, the transition
seems natural, in my opinion, to the hero lost in the cavern, to the
hero become foolish, to the peasant who shuts the door of the stable
when the cow has been robbed, or to the mayor of Chester, who, being
shut up in the town, shuts the Peppergate, through which the girl who
had been carried off passed. [436] and makes them walk backwards. Hence, to take by the tail, means to take hold of the wrong way, and it
is applied to the ass as well as the cow. It is said in Germany that a
cow once fell into a ditch from which none of the bystanders dared to
extricate it. The peasant to whom the cow belonged came up, and,

according to some, took it fearlessly by the horns, while, according to
others, he dragged it out by its tail, whence can be explained the
double proverb to take by the horns,

[437] we find the same

subject spoken of, of which a variation is given in a German proverb,
"Though the cow's tail moves, it does not fall."

[438] In the hope of this it is that the
wolf, or the fox, runs after the tail of the cow or bull. There is a
Piedmontese story which I heard in my infancy, one comic feature of
which lingers vividly in the memory: a boy who took the hogs to pasture,
cut off their tails and stuck them in the mud, and then made off with
the animals. The owner of the hogs, seeing their tails, is under the
impression that they have sunk into the mud. He tugs at them, brings
away their tails, but cannot fish up their bodies. In a Russian story
given by

[439] we read that the cunning Little
Thomas (Thomka, Fomka) cheats the priest of his horse (in some versions
his ass) by cutting off its tail and planting it in the mud of a marsh. He makes the priest believe that his horse has fallen into the marsh;
the priest, thinking to pull it out, gives one stiff tug, and falls down
on his back with the tail in his hand; upon which Tom persuades him to
believe that he has broken it off himself, and to be content with the
recovery of so much of the lost animal. In the fifty-seventh Gaelic
story of Campbell,

[440] a priest endeavours to pull out of
the water a drowning sheep,

but
the tail comes away, and the story-teller adds, "If the tail had not
come off, the story would have been longer." And so the owner of the
cow, the robber of which has left the tail behind as a consolation, has
in reality but little, but yet this little is something; for, just as
the slipper left behind her by the fugitive girl, although it is of
little value, enables the hero to identify her, so in the tail of his
cow the owner has something in hand to set out on its search with, and
to recover his lost property; either because the tail of an animal is
like its shadow and serves to trace it, as the slipper does the maiden
by showing the footstep; or else, because tailless cows are evidently
stolen ones. (In the myth of Cacus, in which Hercules traces the stolen
oxen by the footprints, and Cacus drags them by their tails, the
mythical figure of the slipper and that of the lost tail are perhaps
united. It is possible that the tails of the oxen came off in the hands
of Cacus when dragging them into the cavern, and that, thrown away by
the brigand, and found by Hercules, they may have served him as a guide
to recover his oxen. It is also possible that Cacus, pursued by
Hercules, had not time to drive the oxen in entirely, but that their
tails still protruded and betrayed their whereabouts. Relative to the
Latin legend of Cacus, these are simply hypotheses, and I have therefore
enclosed them in a parenthesis; but inasmuch as in the above-quoted
Russian story, we find the horse's tail cut off by the robber, and as in
the chapter on the fox, we shall see the fox who betrays himself by not
drawing in his tail, whence the proverb, "Cauda de vulpe testatur," the
two hypotheses advanced above are, after all, not so visionary.) In

[441] the hero Aristomenes, who has been
thrown into a deep cistern, liberates himself in a

marvellous manner by means of an eagle, after a fox had opened a
passage. The fox's tail has such a bewitching power of attraction, that
according to popular tradition, when it is moved the cock falls down
unable to resist the charm. According to popular belief, the tail (as
well as the nose and mouth) is the most splendid part of the body of an
animal. The great monkey Hanumant, with his tail on fire, burns Lanka
(in the same way as the burning tails of the foxes of the biblical
Samson burn the ripe harvests of the Philistines). The grey, or black,
horse of mythology (having devoured the solar white, or red horse) emits
fire from his mouth or tail. This black horse being the night, the
horse's jaws and tail, which emit fire, represent the luminous heavens
of evening and of morning; when, therefore, the tail of his horse
(stolen by the robber in the same way as the bull and the cow

[442]) remains in the mythical hero's
hand, this light-streaming tail is enough to enable him to find the
whole animal,

[443]), the bull-sun finds his cow the
aurora again; the prince sun, the princess aurora; the peasant recovers
his ass or his cow; Hercules, his oxen; the white horse comes out of the
tail of the black horse, who had eaten him, and then, by means of the
tail, ascends to heaven;

[444] the white

bull
comes out of the black one; the white, or the red, cow comes out of the
black cow; the tail comes out of the body; the hero comes out of the
sack, or hide, in which he had been enclosed or sewed up. The sack plays
a great part in the tradition of the hidden or persecuted hero; this
sack is the night or the cloud, or the winter; the hero shut up in the
sack, and thrown into the sea, is the sun. The hero enclosed in the sack
and thrown into the sea, and the heroine shut up in a chest (covered,
moreover, with a cow's hide, in the myth of PasiphÃ¤e) or barrel, and
abandoned to the water,

[445] are equivalent to each other, and
so are the heroes shut up in the well, in the cavern, in the stables,
and even in the cow. Inasmuch as the sack in which, according to the
proverb quoted above, the delinquent hero is to be sewed, is an old
cow's-hide, or else the hide of an old cow, or a dark one (of the
night), when this black cow sits on the eggs of the bird of evening, to
hatch them, the eggs come to evil; whence I derive the German proverb,
"When the cow sits upon the

eggs, do not expect fowls."

[446] And when the night was observed to
overwhelm the sun and withdraw him from human sight, this other proverb
took its origin, "The black cow has crushed him." The black cow does not
only crush the hero, but, as the wolf does, shuts him up in her own
hide,

[447] in her own sack,

[448] encloses in the sack, the dwarf
comes out of the sack while the wolf is emptying his body. Of two
Russian stories given by

play
a great part in popular Indo-European tradition. [449] From the sack of the funeral stork
(the night), in a Russian story,

[450] come forth two young heroes (the
AÃ§vinÃ¢u), defeaters of their enemies, who spread out the tablecloth of
abundance (the aurora), and a horse which drops gold (the sun). The hero
shut up in the sack, or the cow's hide, and thrown into the water,
escapes from shipwreck in the same way as those navigators of the
Chinese sea described in his voyages by Benjamin of Tudela, who, he
says, when shipwrecked, escaped being swallowed up by the waves by
covering themselves with the whole hide of a cow or an ox; for the
eagles, mistaking them for real, flew to the spot and pouncing upon
them, drew them ashore. The ship with the buffalo's hide is found again
in popular stories. This is evidently a reminiscence of mythical
derivation (from which was, perhaps, afterwards derived the idea of
torture, as in the famous bull of Phalaris, in which many see a symbol
of the god of the waters, the bull's hide in which the tetrarch
Acarnides, vanquished by Memnon, was sewed up,

[451] in antiquity, and, in the Middle
Ages, the ox's hide in which, according to the chronicles, the horrid
Duke of Spalato Euroia orders Paulus Chuporus, prefect of the Emperor
Sigismond, to be sewed, to revenge himself upon him, because he had, out
of contempt, saluted him by bellowing like an ox). Thus with the Celtic
hero Brian,

[452] the pretended fool, who speculates
upon the stupidity of those who are reputed wise. When one

of
these so-called sages, deceived by him, proposes to throw him into the
sea shut up in a sack, he makes another man take his place by means of a
witty invention, as Goldoni's liar would say, whilst he himself comes
back to the shore with a whole herd of cattle. In the other Celtic,
Slavonic, German, and Italian variations of this story, the would-be
fool begins his fortune-making, in one version, by putting a few coins
into his dead cow's hide, and then selling it at a very high price as a
purse which will give out money whenever shaken; and in another, by
palming off his ass or horse, persuading the purchaser, by means of an
easy deceit, to believe that it yields gold and silver, and thus
obtaining a high price for it. With the cow are also connected the two
horns, by blowing into which he causes his wife, who feigns death, to
rise to life again, which horns he thus prevails on his brothers or
companions to buy at a great ransom, who, thinking themselves cunning,
and wishing by means of the horns to speculate upon corpses,

[453] begin by killing people, and are
ruined. I have said above, that the sack in which the hero is generally
enclosed is the same as the chest in which the heroine is usually shut
up on account of her beauty, that is to say, in which the beautiful
heroine hides her splendour, or in which the red cow, the evening aurora
with the sun, loses herself. The fourteenth Scottish story of Mr J. F. Campbell's contains the following narrative:–A king, whose first wife
(the morning aurora) is dead, engages to marry the woman whom the dead
queen's dresses will fit, and finds no one who can wear them except his
own daughter (the evening aurora). She makes her father give her gold
and silver dresses and shoes (that is, she takes from her father,
the

sun,
the splendour of the morning aurora); she shuts herself up with them in
a chest, and lets herself be thrown into the sea. The chest drifts about
on the waves, and comes at last to the shore; the beautiful maiden
enters the service of a young king; she shows herself in church with her
splendid robes; the young king, who does not recognise his servant-maid
in this beautiful princess, becomes enamoured of her, and hastens to
overtake her; she flees and loses her golden slipper; the king finds it,
and to discover her, has it measured on every foot; many maidens cut off
their toes to make the slipper go on, but a bird divulges the deceit;
the young king marries the beautiful maiden who came out of the wooden
chest. Here we have again, not only the heroine who escapes, but the
walking heroine; this heroine is the aurora, and the aurora is often a
cow. Another swift cow passes in the proverb before the hare (the
leaping moon), in the fable of the ant and the grasshopper, of which the
former represents the cloud or the night, or Indras or the aurora in the
cloud of night, or the earth,

[454] and the latter, the leaping one,
the moon; the ant passes the grasshopper in the race, not because it
walks faster, but because the two runners must necessarily meet, and
therefore the one must pass the other. The English infantile rhyme,
"Hey! diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the
moon," refers to the myth of the cow which jumps over the hare. The
observation of celestial phenomena being afterwards neglected, and it
being forgotten that the

running ant or cow meant the cloud, or the sun, or the aurora, or the
earth, and the jumping hare or grasshopper the moon, only a regular and
parallel race, on the terrestrial soil, between cow and hare, or ant and
grasshopper, was seen; and from the myth of the two animals which meet
and pass each other in the sky, was derived, according to the different
characters of nations or eras, a double proverb–one deriding the slow
and rash animal which presumes to try and overtake the swift one in the
race, the other serving as an example to prove the truth of the
sentence, "Tarde sed tute," which, in Italian, is "Chi va piano va sano
e va lontano" (he who goes slowly, goes well and far). The first proverb
has for its parent the Greek one, "to hunt the hare with an ox," which,
in Italian, is "pigliar la lepre col carro" (to take the hare with a
car);

[455] referring to cases where means
disproportionate to the end are made use of. When the hare and the cow
meet, if the cow is obliged to stop the hare, she crushes it, as we have
seen above that she crushes the bird's eggs instead of hatching them. The idea, moreover, of the ox hunting the hare arose naturally out of
the idea of the ox or cow overtaking and passing beyond the hare. To
these proverbs can perhaps be joined the next German one:–"All who blow
the horn do not hunt hares," which is now directed against those who
think by an easy method, such as blowing a horn, to accomplish a
difficult enterprise, such as hunting a hare; in the same way as in
Germany it is said, that all thunder-clouds do not give rain, and the
cow must do more than low in

order to have much milk, or the cow that lows most is not the one that
yields most milk. [456] In fact, a cow which lows much is
unwell, neither while it is lowing can it eat and make milk; so he who
fatigues himself with blowing the horn is not able, at the same time, to
run after the hare; as in the Italian proverb, "Il can che abbaia non
morde" (the dog that barks does not bite), for the simple reason that
whilst he opens his mouth to bark, he cannot shut it to bite. The hen
that clucks, on the other hand, is the one that lays the egg, because
the act of clucking with the mouth does not interfere with the operation
of egg-laying; there is no incompatibility of offices. which the god Ká¹ishá¹as, having been hospitably entertained by her,
refills with beans, and of the lord who, in an unpublished Piedmontese
legend, disguised as a poor old man, throws pebbles into the kettle of
the pious widow, which, as soon as thrown in, become kidney-beans,
involve the same myth. In the same way I think the kidney-bean is
evidently intended by the fruit of fruits, which, according to the

[457] In the English fairy tale of "Jack
and the Bean-stalk," Jack barters his cow for some beans; his mother
(the blind cow) scatters the beans; one of them takes root, and grows up
to the sky. [458] By means of the black cow, of the
funereal or blind cow, of the cow-aurora, which becomes black or blind
during the night, the hero finds the bean or the pea of abundance (the
moon), by means of which he sees again in the morning and becomes
rich. We have seen a sack, instead of the hide of a black cow, used to
signify the night; in like manner, after or instead of this same cow's
hide (which the hero goes to sell), as well as the pea or bean, we have
the pipkin–the poor hero finds the moon. The Slavonic story of the
potter who becomes rich, and that of the brother believed to be stupid,
who sells at a high price his pipkin, which makes
the beans boil without a fire, are varieties of the same subject. In a
Russian story in Afanassieff,[459] the amphora takes the place of the
pipkin that makes its owner rich. The poor brother draws it out of the
water; from the broken amphora comes a duck, which lays one day golden
eggs, and the next silver ones–the sun and the moon (at morning the
aurora hatches the golden day, at evening the silver night). We have still to explain the proverbs of the cow that laughs and the
cow that spins. The laughing aurora (after having, during the night,
acted the princess that never laughs) and the spinning aurora (in
relation with the cow, the moon, that spins by means of its horns) are
already known to us. The aurora laughs at morn in the sky, at the sight
of her husband; thus the princess that never laughs, in a numerous
series of Slavonic, German, and Italian stories, laughs when she sees
her predestined husband.[460] The proverb of the cow that laughs
is connected with that of the cow that speaks; it is perhaps on this
account that bulls and cows (and other animals) which speak, and say and
do complimentary things among themselves, in an entire cycle of
Indo-European stories,
which have been learnedly illustrated by Professor Benfey, in Orient
und Occident, under the title of "Ein MÃ¤rchen von der
Thiersprachen," always make the man who understands, and indiscreetly
listens to their language, laugh. But if the man reveals what the bulls
or cows (or other animals) have said to each other, he prepares his own
ruin: the language and the inner life of animals must not be divulged to
all; if published abroad, the augury is a sinister one. That which makes
the princess of the Russian tale laugh, is seeing the courtesy which the
animals, like men, show to the man taken out of the mud; that which
makes the man who understands the language of animals laugh, is seeing
them speak and act to each other exactly as men do in similar private
relations. To betray this mystery is to wish for one's death. No one
must know what the bull said in secret to the cow, the sun to his
mistress, what the king said in the queen's ear. The violator of the
mysteries of Venus is guilty of sacrilege, and merits the punishment of
death, or at least brings evil down upon his head. Woe to the heroine if
the hero hidden in the skin of an animal, on account of some
indiscretion, or because she has spoken to her sisters, shows himself
naked in his human form; she loses him, and their separation is
inevitable. [461] that is, the goddesses, or divine
and knowing wives, the fairy goddesses (women with their presentiments,
the women that know more than the devil), are also prophetic cows; these
cows, in their character of fairies, speak with

a
human voice, and so do the cloud-bulls. Hence the Romans could take
their auguries from an ox that spoke with a human voice. It has been
said that this omen was a sinister one, but it is a mistake. According
to Livy, under the consulate of Cn. Domitius and L. Quintius, an ox
threw Rome into terror by the words,

over
with her robes. The cuckoo, or Zeus, disappears soon after having
spoken, that is, announced the summer loves of the sun. After St John's
Day the cuckoo, who appears in March, is no longer seen; so the ox, soon
after it has spoken and betrayed the loves of Zeus, or soon after the
cloud has thundered, revealing the secret loves of the sun within the
sky covered with clouds, or the confidential speeches and secret
caresses of the animals, pays for this indiscretion by his own death. As
the aurora is represented in the Vedic hymns by a maiden who does not
laugh, and smiles only when she sees her husband,

[462] so the lightning that tears the
cloud and comes before the thunder is compared to the laughing of an ox
or a cow, or else of the man who has seen their loves. As long as the
sky only lightens, or merely smiles,

[463] there is little harm done. No one
can know as yet why the ox or the cow, the hero or heroine, or the third
person who is looking on, smiles before the spectator; but when the hero
or the heroine speaks, betraying the thought or singular surprise which
makes him or her smile, the penalty of the indiscretion is death; the
thundering cloud is soon dissolved into rain. Nor will my identification

of
the cloud that lightens (making a distinction between the lightning and
the thunderbolt) with the smiling cow, or ox, or man who, understanding
the language of animals, as they speak in low tones, and seeing their
most familiar habits, smiles, seem forced when we reflect that our
language has preserved the figures of a ray of joy, of a flash of joy,
to indicate a smile, of which we say that it shines, illumines, or
lightens. Lightning is the cloud's smile. In the ninth story of the
third book of

[464]

The fish is a phallic symbol (in the Neapolitan dialect,
pesce, fish, is the phallos itself). The fish that laughs
because it has been the spectator of adultery is the phallos itself
in gaudio Veneris. The thunderbolt of Indras is his
phallos that breaks the cloud. In Ovid,[465] we have Jupiter, who, by means of
riddles, teaches Numa the way of forming the thunderbolt. "CÅ“de caput, dixit, cui Rex, Parebimus, inquit;

CÅ“denda est hortis eruta cepa meis. Addidit hic, Hominis: Summos, ait ille,
capillos. Postulat hic animam: cui Numa, Piscis,
ait. Risit; et His, inquit, facito mea tela
procures,

O vir colloquio non abigende meo."

The joke of the April fish (le poisson d'Avril), with which so many
of our ladies ingenuously amuse themselves, has a scandalously phallical
signification.[466] The fishes of the Zodiac are
twins, a male and a female bound together, born of ErÃ´s (Amor) and
AphroditÃª (Venus). In the Adiparvam of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, we
read of a fish which devours a man's seed, and a girl who, having eaten
it, brings forth a child. The same myth occurs again in the Western
popular tales. The cow that spins still remains to be explained. We have already
seen that the cow spins with her horns for the maiden; this cow is,
generally, the moon, which spins gold and silver during the night. The
aurora is ordered by her step-mother, the night, both to pasture the cow
(the moon) and spin. If the cow-maid is to take care of her cow and
guard her well, she will be able to spin but little; whence the German
proverb is right when it says that if the cow-maid must spin there will
be little yarn. The good cow-maid prefers to keep her cow well, and pays
every regard to it, in order that it may find good pasturage; then the
grateful cow (the moon) puts gold and silver upon its horns to spin for
the maiden.[467] In the morning the girl appears
upon the mountain with the gold and silver yarn, with the gold and
silver robes given her by the good fairy or by the good cow.[468] And when the old woman kills the
cow, the girl who keeps its bones and sows them in the garden sees,
instead of the cow, an apple-tree with gold and silver apples grow up,
by offering one of which to a young prince the maiden obtains a husband,
whilst perverse women are beaten by the apple-tree or find themselves
opposed by horns. This apple-legend is a variation of the star which
falls upon the good maiden's forehead on the mountain, and of the horns,
or donkey's tail, which grow out of the forehead of the bad sister who
has maltreated the cow or badly combed the Madonna's head. The story of
the good maiden and the wicked one, of the beautiful and the ugly one,
finishes with the attempt made by the ugly and wicked girl to take the
place of the beautiful and good one in her husband's bed, in the same
way as, in other stories, a black washerwoman tries to take the place of
the beautiful princess; and this conclusion brings us to the interesting
story of the spinning Berta, or Queen Bertha, as she is called. In German mythology we have the luminous Berchta, who spins, in
contrast with the dark and wild Holda at the fountain (the washerwoman
of fairy tales). The former seems
to be (besides the moon as a white woman, in her period of light, the
silvery night) the aurora, the spring, or the luminous aspect of the
heavens; the latter (besides the moon in her period of darkness,
Proserpina or PersephonÃª in hell), the dark night, winter, the old
witch.[469] The same name is given to the
various phenomena of the gloomy sky, in the same way as a contrary name
is given to the various phenomena of the luminous heavens. On this
account lunar and solar myths, daily and annual myths, enter into the
story of Berta or Berchta. Berta, like the cow of the fairy tales, spins silver and gold. Therefore, when we say in Italy that the time when Berta spun is
past,[470] this expression means, that the
golden age, the age in which gold abounded is past. And instead of this
expression we also use another in Italy to denote an incident which took
place in a very ancient era, at a time very remote from the memory of
men; we say, in the times of King Pipino (Pepin). Queen Berta having
been the wife of Pepin, it was natural that the times of the husband
should correspond to the fabled era of his wife, who was, tradition
alleges, mother of Charlemagne, the hero so-named of the legends, of
whom it is said, in Turpin's Chronicle, that he had long feet, and his
alter ego Orlando (a new and splendid mediÃ¦val form of the twin
heroes), rather than of the King Charlemagne of history. German
Venus, who has swan's feet. It is this large foot that distinguishes her
from other women, and enables her husband to recognise her, in the same
way as it is the foot, or footprint (the sun follows the path taken by
the aurora), that betrays and discovers the fugitive maiden, who, we
have said, is the aurora with the vast chariot (the vast chariot which,
if it pass over the hare, may crush it. Frau Stempe, and Frau Trempe,
and the large-footed Bertha, are the same person)–vast, because she
occupies a large extent of the heavens when she appears. When standing
on the chariot, she seems to have no feet, or a very small, an
imperceptible foot; but the chariot on which she stands and which
represents her foot is so much the larger; therefore when we leave the
chariot out of account, and suppose, on the contrary, that she goes on
foot, inasmuch as, when walking, she takes up much room, the swan's, or
goose's, or duck's foot given to her in the myth of Freya and the legend
of Berta is quite suited to her. And seeing, as we have said, that the
foot (the myths almost always speak of one foot alone; even the devil is
lame, or has only one foot) and the tail of an animal are often
substituted for each other in mythology, we can understand how, in a
Russian story,

[471] the hero who has fallen into a
marsh was able to deliver himself by clutching hold of the tail of a
duck. This duck being the aurora, and having a wide spreading tail as
well as a large foot, the solar hero, or the sun, can easily, by holding
on to her, raise himself out of the swamp of night. There is a German
story

[472] in

which
the white woman, or the Berta, is transformed into a duck. In another
German legend,

[473] instead of the swan-footed Berta,
we have the Virgin Mary (who, as a maiden, represents the virgin aurora,
always pure, even after having given birth to the sun; like the KuntÃ® of
the

[474] The same luminous Berta also
assumes, in popular German tradition, the form of St Lucia, that is, the
saint who, after having been made blind, became the protectress of
eyesight. Of the blind or black cow of night is born the luminous cow of
morning, the aurora that sees everything herself and makes us see
everything. For the same reason that the cow or duck, Berta, is
consecrated

to St
Lucia, whose appearance she assumes, the bull (the sun) is sacred to St
Luke, the festival of whom is on this account celebrated at Charlton,
near London, with a horn-fair or exhibition of horns, generally
ornamented and perfumed. [475] Hence the

Italian proverbs, "Dar la Berta" (to give the Berta), and "Pigliar la
Berta" (to take the Berta), meaning to deride and to be derided. But
instead of to give the Berta, in Italy we also say, "Dar la madre
d'Orlando" (to give the mother of Orlando). The

[476] when Orlando dies, Charlemagne
says that Orlando was his right arm, and he has no longer anything to do
in life without him; but he lives long enough to avenge the death of
Orlando; and after this vengeance, the heroic life of Charlemagne comes
at once to an end. In the

AÃ§vinÃ¢u, thus Berta may, mythically, be mother or sister of Charlemagne,
and yet be always the mother of Orlando). It would be a never-ending work to collect together all the Germanic,
Scandinavian, and Celtic legends which, in one way or another, are
connected with the myth of the cow and of the bull. The literature
relating to this subject is composed not of one or a hundred, but of
thousands of volumes, of which some (such, for instance, as the poem of
the Nibelungen, and the poems of the Round Table)
individually contain, in the germ, almost the whole diverse world of
fairy tales. I must therefore limit myself to the indication of the more
general features, leaving to more diligent investigators the minuter
comparisons; and esteeming myself, I repeat, too happy if my brief
notices should be found clear enough to spare others the labour of
preparing the warp upon which to weave comparisons. From what we have said thus far, it seems to me that two essential
particulars have been made clear:–1st, That the worship of the bull and
the cow was wide-spread, even in northern nations; 2d, That the mythical
bull and cow were easily transformed into a hero and heroine. [477] As a symbol of generation, the
bull is the best adapted to propitiate the married couple; so the priest
in the

the
mysteries of Venus. Thus the

[478] Thus, when the wolf dies (in a
German writing of the twelfth century), it is the ox that reads the
gospel. [479] Besides marriages and funerals,
the bull or ox also appears, finally, as in the Hindoo ceremonial, in
pregnancy. Gargamelle, while she has Gargantua in her womb, eats an
excessive quantity

[480] of tripe of fattened

oxen. When she feels the pains of child-birth, her husband comforts her with
an agricultural proverb of Poitou, "Laissez faire aux quatre beufz de
devant;" and she then gives birth to Gargantua, who comes out of her
left ear, in the same way as in the Slavonic stories we find the heroes
come out of the ears of the horse (or of the ass of night; the luminous
solar hero comes out of the ears of the ass, or of the grey or black
horse; the twin horsemen come out of the two ears). Rabelais, to explain
this extraordinary birth, asks "Minerve ne naquit-elle pas du cerveau
par l'aureille de Iupiter?" No sooner is Gargantua born, than he asks
with loud cries for something to drink; to give him milk, 17,913 cows
are brought, his mother's breasts not being enough, although each time
she is milked she yields "quatorze cens deux pipes neuf potÃ©es de
laict." This is the giant of popular tradition, whom the gigantic
phantasy of Rabelais has coloured in order to make him the butt of an
immense satire. It is an amplified and humorous rendering in a literary
form of the popular Superlatif,

[481] whose mythical character is
revealed in the curse hurled against him by the old dwarf-fairy, whom he
maltreated: "One sun, to accomplish his work, eats eleven entire moons;
but this time every moon will eat the work of a sun." The ascending and
descending life of the solar hero is thus indicated. Superlatif will
become continually smaller, until it seems as though he were about to
disappear altogether; but at that very instant the curse comes to an
end, and from a dwarf, he grows into a giant again in the arms of his
bride. [482] Thus the days

become
continually shorter and shorter, till the winter solstice, till
Christmas. At Christmas the sun is born again, the days lengthen, the
dwarf grows tall; the sun, by a double but analogous conception of
ideas, passes once each day and once each year from giant to dwarf, and
from dwarf to giant. (no
one can resist the cries or the whistling of the hero of fairy tales;
the bellowing of the bull makes the lion tremble in his cave). In this
learned lesson on Germanico-Scandinavian mythology, given us by the
dwarf Allwis, we have a further justification of the transition which we
here assume to have been made from the natural celestial phenomenon to
its personification in an animal, and to the personification of the
animal in a man: Allwis, who knew all things, has explained the mystery
to us. SECTION VI. The Bull and the Cow in Greek and Latin

to search for the mythical and legendary forms assumed there by the bull
and the cow, the mass of available material in point which offers,
instead of diminishing, has increased prodigiously. Not to speak of the
rich literary traditions of mediÃ¦val Italy and Spain (as to those of
France, they are often but an echo of the Celtic and Germanic), nor the
significant traditions of the Latin historians and poets themselves, nor
the beliefs, superstitious customs, and legends still existing on the
half-Catholic, half-Pagan soil of Italy, all of which are notably
fraught with the earliest mythical ideas, we here find ourselves face to
face with the colossal and splendid edifice of Greek poetry or mythology
itself; for that which constitutes the greatness and real originality of
Greek poetry is its mythology, by means of which it is that a divinity
breathes in every artistic work of Hellenic genius. The poet and the
artist are almost always in direct correspondence with the deities, and
therefore it is that they so often assume such a divine and inspired
expression. It would, therefore, be a bold presumption on my part if I
were to essay to extract and present, in a few pages, the soul, the
contents of this endless mythology. I have, moreover, the good fortune
of being able to plead relief from the obligation to venture on any such
attempt, by referring the reader to the learned preparatory works
published in England, in the same interest, by Max MÃ¼ller and George
Cox, upon the Hellenic myths in relation to the other mythologies. It is
certainly
possible to take exception to interpretations of particular myths
proposed by these two eminent scholars, as, no doubt, might be the fate
of many of mine, were I to enter into minute explanations, and were my
lucubrations fortunate enough to obtain any measure of consideration. But as I flatter myself with the hope that, notwithstanding occasional
diversions, in which I may have gone aside and lost myself for a few
minutes, I am taking the royal road which alone leads to the solution of
the great questions of comparative mythology, I recognise with gratitude
the labours of Max MÃ¼ller and Cox upon Greek mythology, the writings of
Michael BrÃ©al upon Roman mythology, the immortal work of Adalbert Kuhn
upon the Indo-European myth of fire and water, and a few other helpful
beacon-towers which send their light-shafts clear and steady athwart the
waste, and serve as useful guides to the studious navigator of the
mare magnum of the myths. And because that which there is yet
to do is immense in proportion to the little that has been done well, I
shall take for granted what has already been demonstrated by my learned
predecessors (to one and all of whom I confidently and respectfully
refer my readers), and go on with my own researches, restricting myself,
however, entirely to the zoological field, in order not to increase, out
of all proportion, the dimensions of this opening chapter, which already
threatens to straiten the space I must leave for the rest of my
undertaking. "Bos quoque formosa est,"

maiden EurÃ´pÃª. Her brothers wonder why oxen wish to marry women; but we
shall not wonder when we remark that IÃ´ and EurÃ´pÃª are duplicates of one
and the same animal, or, at least, that IÃ´ and EurÃ´pÃª both took the
shape of a cow–one as the moon especially,

[483] the other, the far-observing
daughter of Telephaessa, the far-shining,

[484] as the moon also, or the aurora. In the first case it is the heroine that becomes a cow; in the second,
it is the hero who shows himself in the shape of a bull. [485] These forms are, however, only
provisional and unnatural, in the same way as in the Vedic hymns the
representation of the aurora, the moon, and the sun as cow and bull is
only a passing one. The cow and the bull send their calf before them;
the sun, the moon, and the aurora are preceded or followed by the
twilight. Jupiter and Minerva have for their messenger the winged
Mercurius; and hence also Ovid

[486] was able to sing:–

"Mactatur vacca MinervÃ¦,

Alipedi vitulus, taurus tibi, summe
Deorum."[487]

The
fruit of the nuptials of IÃ´ and of EurÃ´pÃª with Zeus is of a monstrous
nature, such as the evil-doing daughters of Danaos, who, on account of
their crimes, are condemned in hell to fill the famous barrel (the
cloud) that is ever emptying (the counterpart of the cup which, in the
Scandinavian myth, is never emptied); such too as MinÃ´s, he who ordered
the labyrinth to be made, the infernal judge, the feeder of the
MinÃ´tauros (of which the monstrous bull of Marathon, first subdued by
HÃªraklÃªs and afterwards killed by Theseus, is a later form), the son of
his wife and the gloomy and watery black bull PoseidÃ´n. Even Kadmos, the
brother of EurÃ´pÃª, ends his life badly. He descends into the kingdom of
the dead in the form of a serpent. Of good, evil is born, and of evil,
good; of the beautiful, the hideous, and of the hideous, the beautiful;
of light, darkness, and of darkness, light; of day, night, and of night,
day; of heat, cold, and of cold, heat. Each day and each year the
monotonous antithesis is renewed; the serpent's head always finds and
bites its tail again. A Tarentine verse of Arnobius expresses very
happily these celestial vicissitudes:

"Taurus draconem genuit et taurum draco."

Thus, in the romance of Heliodoros (Aithiopika) we read that
the queen of Ethiopia, being black, gave birth to a white son; that is
to say, the black night gives birth to the white moon and to the white
dawn of morning. To Zeus (DyÃ¢us, the luminous,) are sacrificed white
bulls; to his brother PoseidÃ´n, black ones; indeed, entirely black[488] ones, according to the Homeric

Maximus,

[497] the empire of the world would, by
an oracle of the time of Servius Tullius, belong to the nation who
should sacrifice to the Diana of the Aventine a certain wonderful cow
belonging to a Sabine (the aurora or the moon, from the sacrifice of
which the sun comes out at morning). The Sabine prepares to sacrifice
it, but a Roman priest takes it from him by fraud, whilst the Sabine is
sent to purify himself in the water near at hand. This is a zoological
form of the epico-mythic rape of the Sabines, of the exchange of the
wife or of the precious object, of the exchange effected in the sack. In
Ovid,

[498] the same myth occurs again with a
variation:

"Matre satus Terra, monstrum mirabile, taurus

Parte sui serpens posteriore fuit. Hunc triplici muro lucis incluserat atris

Parcarum monitu Styx violenta trium. Viscera qui tauri flammis adolenda
dedisset,

Sors erat, Ã¦ternos vincere posse Deos. Immolat hunc Briareus factu ex adamante
securi;

Et jam jam flammis exta daturus erat. Jupiter alitibus rapere imperat. Attulit
illi

Milvus; et meritis venit in astra suis."

We shall return to this myth in the following chapters. The monster
is killed only when his heart, which he keeps shut up, is taken away. Sometimes he does not keep it shut up in his own body, but in a duck
(the aurora), which comes out of a hare (the moon sacrificed in the
morning).[499] When this duck is opened, a golden
egg (the sun) is found. When the egg is thrown on the ground, or at the
monster's head, the monster dies. The golden duck, whence the monster's
heart, the sun, comes forth, is the same as the cow which gives birth to
the lamb (the night gives birth to the aurora, and the aurora to the
solar lamb). The historian Flavius cites, among the prodigies which
preceded the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem, a miracle of this
kind, which took place in the middle of the temple itself, in the case
of a cow led thither to be sacrificed. It occurs still every morning in
the mythical heavens, and was a phenomenon familiar to human observation
in the remotest antiquity, when it became a proverb; but, as often
happened, the proverb which affirmed an evident myth, when its sense was
lost, was
adopted to indicate an impossibility; wherefore we read in the second
satire (cxxii.) of Juvenal:–

"Scilicet horreres maioraque monstra putares,

Si mulier vitulum, vel si bos ederet
agnum?"

In Greek and Latin authors[500] we find frequent examples of the
sacrifice of a bull a short time before the death of the hero by whom it
was ordered, in which it was noticed as a very sinister omen that the
entrails were missing, and particularly the heart or the liver. Having
observed that the monster's heart is the solar hero, or the sun itself,
we can easily understand how, in the sacrifice of a bull, this heart
must be wanting when the hero approaches his end. In the mythical bull
sacrificed at evening, the hero's heart is not to be found; the monster
has eaten his intestines, of which, according to the legend, he is
particularly greedy. But the bull does not always let himself be sacrificed patiently; he
often flees in order not to be killed. We have seen in the Russian
stories how the bull, which his owner intends to sacrifice, flees into
the forest, with the lamb (the bull and the lamb are two equivalent
forms of the morning and evening solar hero) and the other domestic
animals. The proverb of Theokritos, "Even the bull goes into the
forest,"[501] can have no other origin than in
the two analogous myths of the moon which wanders through the forest of
night, and of the sun who hides himself in the same forest, when he sees
the preparations made
for the sacrifice; the sun in the night becomes the moon. [502] Whilst he is hidden in the forest,
the solar bull is black, but often (

Ãschylos. Euripides

[503] says that she gave birth to the
king of the KadmÅ“ans. Here, therefore, we find once more the intimate
relation between IÃ´ and EurÃ´pÃª, the sister of Kadmos, which I noticed
above. Kadmos, the brother of EurÃ´pÃª, unites himself with IÃ´. But IÃ´ is
a cow, and we find a cow, a travelling cow, marked with a white spot in
the shape of a full moon (the moon itself, or IÃ´), in the legend of
Kadmos in BÅ“otia, according to Pausanias,

[504] and to Ovid,

[505] who sings–

"Bos tibi, PhÅ“bus ait, solis occurret in arvis,[506]

Nullum passa jugum, curvique immunis
aratri. Hac duce carpe vias, et, qua requieverit
herba,
