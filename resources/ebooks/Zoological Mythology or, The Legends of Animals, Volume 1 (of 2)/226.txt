G. [792] From a narrative
made to me by my friend Valentino Carrera, an intrepid Alp-climber and
popular dramatist. [793] Referred to by
Martial's epigram:–

"Tam male Thais olet, quam non fullonis avari

Tecta vetus media, sed modo fracta via. Non ab amore recens hircus," &c. [794] With this myth
of the brother Phrixos and of the sister Helle, who pass the sea or fly
through the air with the sheep, is connected the Russian story recorded
above of Ivan and Helena; Ivan is changed into a little kid or lamb. In
the Italian variety of the same story, the sister is thrown into the sea
by the witch. Whilst the brother and sister pass the Hellespont upon the
golden ram, Helle falls into the sea. We learn from ApÃ´llonios, in the
second book of the Argon., that the fleece of the sheep became
gold only when, on its arrival in Colchis, it was sacrificed and
suspended upon an oak-tree. The cloud-ram becomes golden only in the
morning and evening sky.–The luminous fleece can perhaps be recognised
in the bride of the á¹igvedas, who, leaning towards the
relations of KakshÃ®vant, says: "Every day I shall be (properly speaking,
I am) like the little woolly sheep of the gandhÃ¢ri (sarvÃ¢ham asmi romaÃ§Ã¢
gandhÃ¢rÃ®á¹Ã¢m ivÃ¢vikÃ¢);" á¹igv. i. 126. As there is an
etymological analogy, so there may be a mythical analogy between the
gandhÃ¢ri and the gandharvÃ¢s. [795] Book x. [796] Ovid calls the
goat "hÃ¦dorum mater formosa duorum," and sings that the goat herself
broke one of her horns against a tree, which horn the nymph Amalthea
wrapped–

"decentibus herbis

Et plenum pomis ad Jovis ora tulit;"

and Jupiter, when lord of heaven, in reward–

"Sidera nutricem, nutricis fertile cornu

Fecit, quod dominÃ¦ nunc quoque nomen
habet."
