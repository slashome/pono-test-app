[453] KÃ¶hler, the work
quoted above. [454] To this myth of
the cow which goes over the moon, the observation of a lunar eclipse
might have contributed materially, in which the cow earth (in Sanská¹it,
go means earth as well as cow) really passes over the moon or
hare. Or else, the cloud and the night, as a black cow, very frequently
goes over the hare or moon. [455] In the Russian
superstition, when a hare passes between the wheels of the vehicle which
carries a newly-married couple, it bodes misfortune; nor is this without
reason: the hare is the moon; the moon is the protectress of marriages;
if she throws obstacles in the way, the marriage cannot be happy;
consequently, marriages in India were celebrated at full moon. [456] Die Kuh, die
viel brÃ¼llt, gibt nicht die meiste Milch.
