S. Ralston, M.A. The Narodnija Skaski sabrannija selskimi
uÄiteliami, isdanie A. A. Erlenwein (Moskva 1863), and the more
voluminous N. Aphanasieva, Narodnija ruskija skaski, Isd. 2
(Moskva 1860, 1861), have not thus far been translated into other
European languages. I have therefore thought fit to make copious
quotations from them as well for the use of Western readers, as on
account of the real importance of their mythical contents, whilst
awaiting the publication of the competent work which Mr Ralston is
expressly preparing upon Russian songs. [349] iii.
