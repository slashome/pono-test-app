iv. 41.–In the twenty-first story of Erlenwein, the poor brother
obtains wealth by means of a mare's head, while the rich brother, on the
other hand, becomes poor.–In Af. v. 21, the dwarf-boy, who
possesses great strength, enters into the ear of one of the two horses
when in the act of ploughing; upon which they plough of their own
accord, and the old father of the dwarf is at liberty to rest.–In the
sixth Calmuck story, the head of the dead horse, when fallen from the
tree, brings riches and good luck to him who lets it fall, who finds
under it a golden cup: this is a form of the ambrosia which comes out of
the horse's head, which we shall find farther on. [568] The Russian text
seems to me of too much importance, in the history of myths, not to
deserve to be recorded here: "Iediet apiÃ¡t vsadnik: sam Äornoi, adiet va
vsiem Äornom; na Äornom kaniÃ©; padskakÃ¡l k varÃ³tam babijaghÃ­ i is-Äesz,
kak skvosz szemliÅ pravalÃ­lsia; nastÃ¡la noÄ."

[569] IdiÃ³t anÃ¡ i
draszÃ­t. VdrÃºg skaÄet mimo iejÃ¡ vsadnik sam bieloi, adiet v bielom, kon
pod nim bieloi, i sbruja na kaniÃ© biÃ©laja; na dvariÃ© stalo raszvietÃ¡t. IdiÃ³t anÃ¡ dalshe, kak skaÄet drugoi vsadnik; sam krasnoi, adiÃ©t v
krasnom i na krasnom kanie; stalo vshÃ³dit solntze. [570] Yaá¸¥ pÃ¢urusheyeá¹a
