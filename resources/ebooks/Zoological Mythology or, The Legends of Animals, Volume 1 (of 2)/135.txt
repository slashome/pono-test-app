have already noticed, the bull or ox is sacred to St Luke; in Russia, to
the saints Froh and Laver. In Sicily, the protector of oxen is San
Cataldo, who was bishop of Taranto. (For the notices relating to
Sicilian beliefs concerning animals, I am indebted to my good friend
Giuseppe PitrÃ¨.) In Tuscany, and in other parts of Italy, oxen and
horses are recommended to the care of St Antony, the great protector of
domestic animals. In the rural parts of Tuscany, it was the custom, on
the 17th of February, to lead oxen and horses to the church-door, that
they might be blessed. Now, to save trouble, only a basket of hay is
carried to be blessed; which done, it is taken to the animals that they
may eat it and be preserved from evil. On Palm Sunday, to drive away
every evil, juniper is put into the stables in Tuscany. [488] TaÃºrous

bulls are black because they resemble the colour of water. [489]
