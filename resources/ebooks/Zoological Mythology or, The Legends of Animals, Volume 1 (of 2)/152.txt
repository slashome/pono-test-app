[549] Cfr. the first
of the Tuscan stories of Santo Stefano di Calcinaia.–In the
preceding chapter, we have seen how the apples of a certain apple-tree
cause horns to grow on whoever eats them. In an unpublished Italian
story, instead of the apple-tree, we have the fig-tree, and instead of
horns, the tail. It is narrated by an old man of Osimo, in the
Marches:–Three poor brothers, having but little inclination for work, go
in search of fortune round the world. Overtaken in the country by night,
they fall asleep in the open air. A fairy, under the aspect of a hideous
old woman, comes up and wakens them, offering herself as their wife. The
three brothers excuse themselves, and declare that they wish for nothing
except a little money with which to make merry. The fairy answers, "Tell
me what you wish for, and you shall have it." The first asks for a
purse, which shall always be full of money; the second for a whistle, by
blowing into which a whole army of brave combatants would be summoned to
his side; the third a mantle, which would make its wearer invisible. The
fairy satisfies them, and then disappears in flames, like the devil. The
eldest brother, Stephen, goes with his purse into Portugal, where he
plays and loses, but still remains rich. This comes to the
queen-dowager's ears, who wishes to see the stranger, hoping to possess
herself of his secret; she feigns to love him, and the wedding-day is
fixed; but before it comes she has already gained his confidence, and
taking the purse from him, she orders him to be flogged. Stephen returns
to his brothers, relates his grievance, and proposing to revenge himself
upon the queen, induces them to lend him the whistle, which calls armies
into existence. The queen softens towards him, protesting that she
expected to the last that he would have appeared on the day appointed
for the wedding, and that he had been flogged without her knowledge. Stephen gives way, and the whistle passes out of his hands into those of
the queen. He is flogged again, but twice as severely as before. Again
he has recourse to his brothers; he implores, supplicates, and promises
to get everything back by the miraculous mantle; but having obtained it,
he allows himself to be deceived once more by the queen. Deprived of
everything, he wanders about in despair, reduced to beggary. In the
middle of January, he sees a tree covered with beautiful figs; desirous
of them, he eats with avidity; but for every fig that he swallows, a
span of tail as thick as a boa grows on to him. He goes on his way,
still more desperate, till he finds more figs, of a smaller size; he
eats them, and the tail disappears. Contented with this discovery, he
fills a basket with the first figs, and disguised as a countryman, comes
to the palace of the Queen of Portugal. Every one marvels on seeing such
fine figs in January. The queen buys the basket, and every one eats; but
tails immediately grow on their backs. Stephen then dresses himself as a
doctor, and with the little figs, cures many persons. The queen has him
called; he obliges her to confess to him first, and in the confession
makes her say where the three marvellous gifts of the fairy are kept. Having recovered them, he leaves the queen with ten spans of tail, and
returns rich and happy to his brothers. In this story there must be some
parts wanting; it is probable that the fairy warned the brothers not to
discover their secret to any one. The last enterprise, moreover, is more
likely to have been undertaken by the third brother, who always assumes
in fairy tales the part of the cunning one, than by the first-born, who
in this story represents the part of the fool.–Polydorus speaks of the
horse's tail as a chastisement for an insult to Thomas Archbishop of
Canterbury, in the thirteenth book of his Hist. Angl.:–"Irridentes Archiepiscopum, caudam equi cui insidebat,
amputarunt. At postea nutu Dei ita accidit, ut omnes ex eo hominum
genere qui id facinus fecissent, nati sunt instar brutorum caudati."
