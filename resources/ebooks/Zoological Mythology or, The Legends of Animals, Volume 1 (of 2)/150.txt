352. [547] In the
Monferrato, according to the information kindly given me, concerning the
beliefs relative to animals current in this country, by Dr Giuseppe
Ferraro, the young collector of the popular songs and stories of the
Monferrato, it is believed that the horse's teeth hung upon the necks of
infants at the breast cause them to cut their teeth, and that the two
incisors of the horse, when worn, are a spell to charm away every
evil. [548] Mbh.
