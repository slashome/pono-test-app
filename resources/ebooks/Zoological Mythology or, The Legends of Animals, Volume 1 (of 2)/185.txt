Afanassieff, ii. 24. [646] Ib. v. 6. [647] Ib. v. 35. [648] PovÃ­she liessÃº
stajÃ¡Äavo, ponÃ­sze ablakÃ¡ hadiÃ¡Äavo. [649] For instance, in
the Pentamerone, iii. 7, where the king of Scotland sends
Corvetto to steal the horse of the ogre who lives ten miles distant from
Scotland: "Haveva st' Huorco no bellissimo cavallo, che pareva fatto co
lo penniello, e tra le autre bellizze no le mancava manco la parola."
When Corvetto carries off the horse, it cries out, "A l'erta ca Corvetto
me ne porta."–Cfr. also the Pentamerone, iii. 1.–Not only has
the horse the gift of speech, but the chariot too: in the seventh book
of the RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am, 44, the chariot Pushpakam speaks to RÃ¢mas,
and says to him that he alone is worthy of driving it. [650]
