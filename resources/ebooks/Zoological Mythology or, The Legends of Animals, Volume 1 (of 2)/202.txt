29, 5. [711] Quoted by Weber,
Ueber den Zusammenhang indischer Fabeln mit griechischen, where
the braying ass would also appear to be born of the omniform monster:
"Entsteht, nach Ã. xii. 7, 1, 5, nebst Ross und Maulthier, aus dem Ruhm
(yaÃ§as, which, however, may perhaps here also simply mean splendour),
welcher dem Ohr des getÃ¶dteten ViÃ§varÃ»pa TvÃ¢shá¹­ra entfloss, worin der
Bezug auf sein lautes Geschrei wohl nicht zu verkennen ist."–We have
already seen, in the Russian stories quoted in the preceding chapter,
how the two horsemen who protect the hero come out of the ears of the
grey horse, and how the hero himself, entering by one ear, and coming
out of the other, finds a heroic horse. Here we can, perhaps, detect an
allusion to the long-eared ass, in the same way as in the appellation of
Ã¢Ã§rutkará¹as, or the ear which listens, given to Indras (á¹igv. i. 10, 9), the long-eared Indras may possibly be a form representing the
long-eared Midas, or the ass with long ears. [712] Gatiá¹ khara
