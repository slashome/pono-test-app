12. [259] The word
badhiras means here the crooked, the crippled one, and not the
deaf (from the root badh or vadh, to wound, to cut);
the more so that here the name of the blind man's companion is
Mantharakas, a word which properly means the slow one. The curved line
and the slow line correspond; and the curved one, who cannot stand
upright, may be the hunchback just as well as the cripple, the crooked,
the lame.–Cfr. The chapter on the Tortoise. [260] For the incident
of the hunchback who betrays the blind man, in the same popular tale,
cfr. next chapter. [261] i. 6527. [262] SÃ¢udÃ¢minÃ®va
