Spiegel says, however, "Vom Aufgang der Sonne bis Tagesanbruch," which
in a note he explains, "Vom Sonnenaufgang bis Mitternacht," which it

inferred from this, that the sacrifice was to be made "den ganzen Tag
hindurch." Zarathustra would not have been obliged to ask the precise
time at which to sacrifice to the goddess, if she was to answer him in
such a general way. What occasion is there to pray in midday, in full
daylight, that the darkness may be dispersed?â€“If there be any equivoque,
it can only be, in my opinion, in the rather frequent exchange of the
maiden Aurora and the fairy Moon. [285] Cfr.
