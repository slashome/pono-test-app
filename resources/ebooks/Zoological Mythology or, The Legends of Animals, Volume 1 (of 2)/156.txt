of Rosen, ii. 300. [571] Tad agne Äakshuá¸¥

"And washed their horses in the well

That springs by Vesta's fane."

–Battle of the Lake Regillus,
xxxix. The salutary water of the Dioscuri, or sons of the luminous one,
would here occupy the place of the fire lighted by night in stables, and
of the Vedic Agnis who kills the monster of horses. My friend Giuseppe
PitrÃ¨ writes me, that in Sicily, when an ass, a mule, or a horse is to
enter a new stable, salt is put upon its back (a form of Christian
baptism), in order that the fairies may not lame it.–The KÃ¼llaros, the
heroic horse of the Dioscuri, is perhaps not unrelated to the word
kÃ¼llos, which means lame and bent; the solar horse, before
being heroic, is hump-backed, lame, lean, and ugly; the lame hero, the
lame horse (ass or mule), the lame devil, seem to me to be three
penumbrÃ¦ of the solar hero, or of the sun in the darkness. [572] Vibhir Ã»hathur
