13. [630] In the Western
stories, instead of the horse's fat or marrow, it is generally the fish
eaten by the queen and her servant-maid which gives life to the two
brothers, who become three when the water in which the fish was washed
is given to be drunk by the mare or the bitch, whence the son of the
mare or bitch is born. I have already attempted to prove the identity of
the fish with the phallos; the fish eaten by the queen, the maid, the
mare, or the bitch, which renders them pregnant, seems to me a symbol of
coition. The horse's fat or marrow smelled by the queen seems to have
the same meaning. [631] VÃ¢Çµino
