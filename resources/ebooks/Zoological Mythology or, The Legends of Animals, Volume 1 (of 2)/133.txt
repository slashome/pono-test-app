Simrock,
the work quoted before, p. 409, and the ninth of the Novelline di
Santo Stefano di Calcinaia, in which the luminous maiden disguised
as an old woman is uncovered by the geese, when she puts down the dress
of an old woman. [473] Simrock, the
work quoted before, p. 410. [474] Wuotan also
saves him whom he protects upon a mantle;–this is the flying carpet or
mantle, hood, or hat, which renders the wearer invisible, and for which
the three brothers disputed, which is also represented as a tablecloth
that lays itself. Thus the poor man who goes to sell his cow's hide
finds the pot of abundance and riches. The dispute for the tablecloth is
the same as the dispute for riches, for the beautiful princess who is
afterwards divided, or else carried off by a third or fourth person who
takes the lion's share. We must not forget the fable of the animals who
wish to divide the stag among themselves, of which the lion takes all,
because he is named lion. In the Nibelungen, Schilbung and
Nibelung dispute with each other for the division of a treasure; they
beg SÃ®frit to divide it; SÃ®frit solves the question by killing them both
and taking to himself the treasure, and the hood that makes its wearer
invisible (Tarnkappe). [475] The romance of
Berta continues in the Reali di Francia in harmony with the
popular stories of an analogous character; the false wife really causes
King Pepin to marry her, and sends Berta into the forest to be killed;
the hired murderers pity her, and grant her her life. Berta, whilst in
the forest bound to a tree (like the Vedic cow), is found by a hunter;
out of gratitude she works (she, no doubt, spins and weaves), in order
that the hunter may sell her work at Paris for a high price. Meanwhile
her father and mother dream that she is beset by bears and wolves who
threaten to devour her, that thereupon, throwing herself into the water,
a fisherman saves her (in the dream, the water has taken the place of
the forest, and the fisherman that of the hunter). King Pepin goes into
the forest, finds her, recognises and marries her, whilst Elizabeth is
burnt alive. The change of wives also occurs in a graceful form (with a
variation of the episode of the beauty thrown into the fountain) in the
twelfth of the Contes Merveilleux of Porchat, Paris, 1863. [476] Histoire de

occasion of the apparent death of the fox, the gospel is read, on the
contrary, by the horse. In the German customs the bull also appears as a
funeral animal, and is fastened to the hearse. If, while he is drawing
the hearse, he turns his head back, it is considered a sinister omen. According to a popular belief, the bulls and other stalled animals speak
to each other on Christmas night. A tradition narrates, that a peasant
wished on that night to hide himself and hear what the bulls were
saying; he heard them say that they would soon have to draw him to the
grave, and died of terror. This is the usual indiscretion and its
punishment.–Cfr. Rochholz, Deutscher Glaube und Brauch, Berlin,
