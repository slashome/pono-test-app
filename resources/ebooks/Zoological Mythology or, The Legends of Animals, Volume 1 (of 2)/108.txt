the chapter on the Peacock. [379] In the Festival
of the Epiphany, which is also a festival of the husband and wife, the
good fairy is accustomed to bring to the child, husband, and wife, a
boot or a stocking full of presents. This nuptial boot occurs again in
the English custom of throwing a slipper after a newly-married couple. Another meaning was also given to the slippers which are thrown away in
the popular belief. Instead of being the heroine's shoes which, having
been abandoned, serve to attract and guide the predestined husband, they
are also considered as the old shoes which the devil leaves behind him
when he flees (his tail, which betrays itself). The Germanic wild
huntress Gueroryssa, another form of the Frau Holle–the phantom of
winter expelled at Epiphany–is represented with a serpent's tail. Hence
in the German carnival the use of the Schuh-teufel laufen, or
running in the devil's slippers. [380] Cfr.
