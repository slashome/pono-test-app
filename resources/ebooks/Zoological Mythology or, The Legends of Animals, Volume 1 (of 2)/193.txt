116, 7. [681] "One spot on the
margin of Lake Regillus was for many ages regarded with superstitious
awe. A mark, resembling in shape a horse's hoof, was discernible in the
volcanic rock; and this mark was believed to have been made by one of
the celestial chargers."–Macaulay, Preface to the Battle of the Lake
Regillus. [682]
Afanassieff, iv. 45. [683] The milk of
white mares, which, according to Olaus Magnus (i. 24) was poured into
the ground by the king of the Goths every year, on the 28th of August,
in honour of the gods, who received it with great avidity, would seem to
be an announcement of the imminent rains of autumn; the horse loses his
ambrosial humour, and his end is at hand. [684] The GrÃ¦co-Latin
proverb, "Equus me portat, alit rex," would seem also to have a mythical
origin, and to refer to the mythical legend of the betrayed blind man,
who carries the cunning hunchback or lame man; who sometimes only feigns
lameness, in order to play off his practical jokes upon his
companion. [685] The fable in
PhÃ¦drus, iv. 24, of the poet Simonides saved by the Dioscuri,
is well known; but the gods punish the miser who refuses to give the
reward that he had promised, not on their own account, but on account of
the wrong done to the poet, whom they love. It is remarkable that, as
the Latin legend shows us the horses of the Dioscuri perspiring, so
PhÃ¦drus represents the Dioscuri themselves as–

"Sparsi pulvere

Sudore multo diffluentes corpore."

This sweat must be the crepuscular mists, in the same way as the poet
Simonides, who alone escapes, being delivered by the Dioscuri, the
ceiling of whose banqueting-hall he had ruined, seems to conceal an
image of the sun saved from the night. [686] Ueber den
