Afanassieff, v. 23.–Ice, in the form of an old man, comes to
try the boiling bath into which the king of the sea wishes to throw the
young hero; when Ice has tried the bath, the youth enters it without
suffering any harm.–The trial of drinking occurs again in a grandiose
form in the combat between Loki and Thor to empty the cup in the Edda of
Snorri, a different form of the Hindoo legend of Agastyas, who dries up
the sea.–Odin, too, as Indras and as BhÃ®mas, at three gulps dries up
three lakes of mead. [403]
