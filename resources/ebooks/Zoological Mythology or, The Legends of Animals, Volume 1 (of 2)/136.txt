Signatus tenui media inter cornua nigro

Una fuit labes; cÅ“tera lactis erant. Ovidius, De Arte Amandi. [491] In
Diodoros, Hammon loves the virgin Amalthea, who has a horn
resembling that of an ox. The goat and the cow in the lunar and cloudy
myth are the same; and on this account we find them both in connection
with the apple-tree, a vegetable form, and with the cornucopia, since
both are seers, and spies, and guides. The golden doe is a variation of
the same lunar myth. [492]
