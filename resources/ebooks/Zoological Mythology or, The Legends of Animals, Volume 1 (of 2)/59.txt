the Tibetan Buddhists, referred to by Professor Schiefner in his
interesting work, Ueber Indra's Donnerkeil (St Petersburg),
1848, we find two valiant heroes who, upon Mount Gá¹idhrakÃ»á¹­a (the
vulture's peak), strive, in presence of their master, to lift the vaÇµram
(that is, the arm in the form of a wedge, the lever-rod, the thunderbolt
of Indras), but in vain; VaÇµrapÃ¢á¹is alone succeeds in lifting the vaÇµram
with his right hand. RÃ¢mas makes a similar trial of strength in the
RÃ¢mÃ¢yaá¹am, when he lifts and breaks in pieces a bow, which no
one had before been able even to move. [244] Cfr.
