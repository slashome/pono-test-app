[346] Cfr. the note of
F. LÃ¶we, illustrating this passage, in his version of the collection of
Kreuzwald, pp. 144 and 145.–[This is also a myth of easy interpretation,
if I am not mistaken: at evening, the sun loses his rays; the lion, the
hero, loses his nails; these nails are picked up by the demoniacal
monster, who forms out of them a hat (the gloom of night, or the
clouds), by which the wearer has the gift of seeing without being seen. The magician who sees with his eyes shut is an interesting variation of
this subject.]

[347] A similar
antithesis is found in a Hungarian proverb, communicated to me by my
learned friend Count Geza Kunn, together with other notices of Hungarian
beliefs relating to animals. This proverb is as follows: "Even the black
cow's milk is white." The black cow is spoken of in two other Hungarian
proverbs; one says, "The black cow has not trodden upon his heel,"
meaning that no misfortune has happened to him; it is the usual
vulnerable heel, the heel of Achilles, the posterior part, for which is
substituted sometimes, as we shall see in the chapter on the Fox and the
Serpent, the tail or extreme hind part. Another proverb is, "In the dark
all cows are black;" but it does not seem to have any mythical
importance. [348] These last have
already been translated into English, and illustrated, by W.
