269, 270. [595] xii. 1, quoted
by Muir in his Sanská¹it Texts, v. 224. [596] In the
Edda we find the AÃ§vinÃ¢u under the forms of night and day. Odin
took Natt and Dag her son, gave them two horses and two drays, and
placed them in the heavens to go round the earth in twenty-four hours. Natt was the first to advance with Hrimfaxe, her horse; he scatters
every morning the foam from his bit upon the earth; it is the dew. The
horse of Dag is named Skenfaxe; the air and the earth are illumined by
his mane. [597] Ã vÃ¢m patitvaá¹
