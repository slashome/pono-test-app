Erlenwein, 5.–In the first story of Erlenwein, the
last-born, Vaniusha (Little John), takes from disputing peasants, by a
stratagem, first a marvellous arrow, then a hat which makes the wearer
invisible, and, finally, a mantle which flies of itself. He promises to
divide them equitably, and for this service makes them pay him
beforehand, each of the three times, a hundred roubles; he then throws
the objects far away and says, that he who is able to find them will
have them; all search, but he alone finds them. (Thus ArÇµunas, in the
MahÃ¢bhÃ¢ratam, hides his wonderful arms in the trunk of a tree,
in which he alone can find them.)

[395] Cfr. Schiefner,
Zur Russischen Heldensage, Petersburg, 1861. This is how the
hero Svyatogor is described in a Russian popular epic song cited by
Ralston (The Songs of the Russian people): "There comes a hero
taller than the standing woods, whose head reaches to the fleeting
clouds, bearing on his shoulders a crystal coffer."
