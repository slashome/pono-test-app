The latter asks his mother
for a quattrino (a small coin) to buy a vetch, and afterwards a bean,
because it grows higher; he sows it, and it attains a marvellous height. Climbing up the bean-stalk he comes to the gates of paradise, which are
opened to him, but St Peter sends him back; he then finds the entrance
to hell, which he wishes to visit. The devil shows him all the sights;
the two then play at cards, and Pipetta wins a sackful of souls. The
devil fears that Pipetta will empty hell, so he allows him to depart
with the sack, and an ass which throws gold from its tail; he mounts up
to heaven, and consigns the sack of souls to St Peter. The story ends
with the usual exchange of asses at the inn where Pipetta sleeps upon
his descent from the beanstalk. [730] Biblion
Istorikon, i. 116.–It is added, that when Titus remonstrated with
his father on his avarice, Vespasian made him smell the gold for which
the horse's dung had been sold, asking him whether it smelt bad.–In the
Mongol story we saw the fool who goes out with his ass and hides it in a
cavern afterwards despoiling a merchant's caravan.–Tzetzas, i. 128, records the existence in Phrygia of a village called "Ass's-ears"
(Ãª klÃªsis onou Ã´ta), inhabited by robbers, and belonging to Midas; he
thinks, moreover, that Midas was surnamed the large-eared on account of
this village of his. [731] vi.
