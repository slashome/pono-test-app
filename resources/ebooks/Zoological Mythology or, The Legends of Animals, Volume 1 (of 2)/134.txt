Porchat,
Contes Merveilleux, Paris, 1863. [482] In
Porchat, Superlatif, while he is a dwarf, is shut up in a
clothes-press; he is a male form of the wooden girl, of the wise puppet,
of the sun hidden in the trunk of a tree, in the tree of night, in the
nocturnal (or cloudy, or wintry) night, full of mysteries, which the
little solar hero surprises from his hiding-place. The hero in hell, or
who, educated by the devil, learns every kind of evil, is a variation of
this multiform idea. The dwarf of Porchat, who comes out of the
clothes-press, is in perfect accord with the popular belief which makes
the man be born in the wood, on the stump of a tree, of which the
Christmas-tree is a lively reminiscence. [483] According to
Eustatius, "IÃ´ gar hÃª selÃªnÃª katÃ  tÃªn tÃ´n ArgetÃ´n dialekton."
