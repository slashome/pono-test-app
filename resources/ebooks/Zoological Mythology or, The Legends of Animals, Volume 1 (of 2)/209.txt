105. [732] Kleitas onÃ´n
hekatombas, xi. 51. [733] In Anton. Liberalis we find a long narrative from which we gather that Apollo
would only suffer the ass to be sacrificed to him among the
Hyperboreans. [734] I read on this
subject in the curious volume Laus Asini, printed at Leyden by
Elzevir, the following notice: "Si quis graviter a scorpione ictus, id
in aurem insusurret asino, ex tempore curetur."

[735]

"Te senior turpi sequitur Silenus asello

Turgida pampineis redimitus tempora
sertis

Condita lascivi deducunt orgya mystÃ¦."

–Seneca, Å’dipus. [736] Tam Ã»hathur
nÃ¢ubhir Ã¢tmanvatÃ®bhir antarikshaprudbhir apodakÃ¢bhiá¸¥; strophe 3.–Cfr. strophe 4th and 5th of the same hymn. [737] Another reason
is also assigned for the honour given to the ass in heaven: the ass and
Priapos contend together as to who is superior; Priapos defeats the ass,
and Dionysos takes pity upon the vanquished, and places it in heaven
among the stars. [738] Laus
Asini, Ludg.
