[466] Cfr. the chapter
on the Fishes; where the custom of eating fish on Friday is also
explained. [467] In the first of
the stories of Santo Stefano di Calcinaia, the cow-maid says to
her cow, "Cow, my cow, spin with your mouth and wind with your horns; I
will make you a faggot of green boughs."

[468] The maiden spins
for her step-mother; the fairy gives luminous robes to the maiden; the
maiden weaves dresses for her husband; these are all details which
confound themselves in one. In the Nibelungen, the virgins
prepared dresses of gold and pearls for the young hero SÃ®frit. [469] Holda, or Frau
Holle, is burnt every year in Thuringia on the day of Epiphany, on which
day (or, perhaps, better still, on the Berchtennacht, the preceding
night, or Berta's night) the good fairy expels the wicked one. In
England, too, the witch is burned on the day of Epiphany.–Cfr. Reinsberg
