4; iv. 17. [759] The walnut-tree
is also found in relation with the goat in a fable of
Afanassieff, ii. 1, that of the accused who exculpate
themselves by inculpating others. The cock and the hen gather nuts
together; the cock throws one which strikes the hen on the ear; the hen
weeps; a boiard asks the reason; the hen accuses the cock, the cock
accuses the walnut-tree, the walnut-tree accuses the goat, the goat
accuses the shepherd, the shepherd accuses the housewife, the housewife
accuses the hog, the hog accuses the wolf, the wolf accuses God, but
beyond God it is impossible to go.–In another jest in verse, intended to
exercise the memory and loosen the tongue, and given by
Afanassieff, iv. 16, we find the goat in connection with
hazel-nuts. The he-goat begins to complain that the she-goat does not
come back with the hazel-nuts (nÃ­et kaszi s ariehami); the song goes on
to say, that the he-goat will send the wolf to find the she-goat, the
bear after the wolf, the men after the bear, the oak-tree after the men,
the axe after the oak-tree, the grindstone after the axe, the fire after
the grindstone, the water after the fire, and the hurricane after the
water; then the hurricane sends the water, the water the fire, the fire
burns the grindstone, the stone grinds the axe, the axe cuts down the
oak-tree, the oak-tree made into a stick (as we have already seen in
Chapters I. and II.) beats the men, the men shoot against the bear, the
bear fights with the wolves, the wolves hunt the she-goat, and here the
she-goat comes back with the hazel-nuts (vot kasza s ariehami). [760]

Afanassieff, vi. 17. [762] In the story,
ii. 32 of Afanassieff, a similar voice has the same effect as
that of the ass; it terrifies all the other animals. However, here, a
goat that has been shorn is alone spoken of,–that is, the goat which has
lost its hair or luminous wool, the thundering goat-cloud.–In the
twenty-fifth story of the first book of the Narodnija iusznoruskija
Skazki (Popular Stories of South Russia), edited by
Rudcenko, Kiev, 1869, the goat terrifies by its voice the first fox and
then the wolf, until she herself is terrified by the voice of the cock. (The morning sun, personified in the cock, destroys the she-goat of
night.)

Afanassieff, iii. 15.–She sends them to the pasturage; a young
blacksmith, who is in her power, adopts the follow mode of deliverance:
He puts his pelisse on outside-in, feigns himself a sheep, and passes
out with the other sheep, escaping thus from the witch: the young sun
comes out at morn like a shepherd-hero among the sheep. Thus Odysseus
delivers himself from the grotto of Polyphemos with his companions, by
hiding himself among the flock which comes out of it. [764] Cfr. the
eleventh of the Novelline di Santo Stefano di Calcinaia, where
we have the lamb instead of the kid. [765] A very
interesting variation of this is contained in another unpublished story
which I heard from a certain Marianna Nesti of Fucecchio in Tuscany. There was once a queen that had a son, who, at the age of seven
years, was enchanted, so that he lay constantly in bed like one deprived
of life. Only at midnight he went out of the house, returning at one
o'clock, covered with blood, and throwing himself as if dead into the
bed. A woman had to remain regularly on the watch for the purpose of
opening the door for him at midnight and at one o'clock; but no girl
had, from very fright, been able to continue in the service more than
one night. Near the city lived an old woman with three daughters; the
two eldest tried to discharge the prescribed duty, but were overcome
with fear; the youngest, more courageous, remained. The first night, at
twelve o'clock, the dead man lifts up one arm; she runs to him and lifts
the other; he tries to raise himself; she helps him to get out of bed. At one o'clock he returns covered with blood, and the girl asks him who
has reduced him to this condition, but he answers nothing, and throws
himself on the bed as if a corpse. The second night she follows him, and
sees him enter a subterranean cavern; he comes to the foot of a flight
of stairs, puts down his mantle and remains as naked as when he was
born, a handsome youth of eighteen years of age. At the summit of the
stairs two great witches cry, "Here he is! come, pretty one!" He ascends
and is beaten by the witches for an hour till blood flows, he crying out
the while for mercy. At one o'clock he is allowed to go, comes back to
the foot of the stairs, takes his mantle and returns home dead. The
third night his attendant again follows him, and when he puts down his
mantle at the foot of the stairs and goes up, she takes the mantle and
presses it tightly; the witches scream. The young man comes to the
summit; but when they try to beat him they cannot lift the stick. Perceiving this, the girl presses and bites the mantle; when she does
so, the witches feel themselves bitten; then the girl runs to the
palace, orders a great fire to be lighted, and throws the mantle into
it; upon its being burnt, the two witches expire, their enchantment is
destroyed, and the prince marries his deliverer. [766] In the eighth
story of the first book of the Pentamerone, the ungrateful
young woman, Renzolla, is condemned by her own protecting fairy to have
the face of a horned goat until she shows her repentance. [767] v.
