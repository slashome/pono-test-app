Targioni Tozzetti, Lezioni di Materia Medica, Firenze,
1821. [512] In an Ãsopian
fable taken from Syntipa, which corresponds to the first of Lokman, two
bulls combine against the lion, and resist him; the lion excites them
against each other, and tears them to pieces. In the sixth fable of
Aphtonios, the bulls are three; in the eighteenth of Avianus, they are
four. The lion already knew the motto of kings: "Divide et impera."
