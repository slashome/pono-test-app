sotte has become proverbial in France, where, in the sixteenth
century, Pierre Gringore wrote a satirical comedy with the title of
Le Jeu de MÃ¨re Sotte, in which the MÃ¨re Sotte is the Catholic
Church. [383] A similar story,
which, on account of its indecent details, I was not able to publish in
my collection of the Novelline di Santo Stefano di Calcinaia,
is narrated upon the hills of Signa, near Florence. It is also told,
with some variations, in Piedmont.–Cfr. a Russian variety of the same
story in the chapter on the Hen. [384] Novelline di
Santo Stefano di Calcinaia, 22. [385] Cfr. the chapter
on the Fishes. [386]
Afanassieff, vi. 59.–But in the tale v. 11, he knows how to
fight well. [387] In England the
monster smells the blood of an Englishman, as in the familiar lines in
Jack the Giant-Killer–

"Fe fo fum,

I smell the blood of an Englishman;

Be he alive or be he dead,

I'll grind his bones to make my bread."
