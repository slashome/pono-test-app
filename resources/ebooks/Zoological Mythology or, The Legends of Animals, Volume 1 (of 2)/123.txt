proverb quoted above, relating to the stable that is shut when the cow
is stolen, is also quoted as follows: "Shutting the stable when the
horse has been stolen."

on the Wolf, where the dwarf enters the wolf by his mouth and comes out
by his tail. [444] In a Russian
story, in

[445] In the Russian
story of lazy and stupid Emilius, who makes his fortune, the hero is
shut up in a barrel with the heroine, and thrown into the sea: the sun
and the aurora, made prisoners, and shut up together, cross together the
sea of night. [446] Wenn sich eine
Kuh auf die Eier legt, so erwarte keine HÃ¼hner; Wander, the work quoted
before. [447] In the Russian
story of Afanassieff, v. 36, the hero-workman kills the
monster-serpent by gambling with him for the price of his own skin. Thinking that he may lose, he has provided himself beforehand with seven
ox hides and with iron claws. He loses seven times; each time the
monster thinks he has him in his power, but the workman as often imposes
upon him with an ox's hide, inducing him to believe that it is his own. At last the serpent loses, and the workman, with his iron claws, really
takes off his skin, upon which the serpent dies. To take the sack or
hide from the monster, to burn the skin of the monster-serpent, goat,
hog, frog, &c., to burn the enchanted mantle or hood in which the
hero is wrapped up, is the same as to kill the monster. [448] See the chapter
on the Wolf.
