Batavorum, ex officina Elzeviriana. [739] "Conferre
aliquid et candori in mulierum cute existimatur. Poppaea certe Domitii
Neronis conjux quingentas secum per omnia trahens fÃ¦tas balnearum etiam
solio totum corpus illo lacte macerabat, extendi quoque cutem credens;"
Aldrov. To which custom Juvenal alludes in his 6th satire:

"Atque illo lacte fovetur

Propter quod secum comites educit asellas

Exul hyperboreum si dimittetur ad axim."

[740] "Finitis
laudibus, surgit quidam archipresbyter, retro se ascendit asinum
preparatum a curia; quidam cubicularius tenet in capite asini bacilem
cum xx. solidis denariorum," &c.; in Du Cange, the work quoted
before, s. v. cornomannia.–We also find in Du Cange that a
soldier was called in the middle ages "caput asini, pro magnitudine
capitis et congerie capillorum."

[741] In the
Pentamerone, iii. 8, the night is called "l'aseno de
l'ombre."

[742] In the
Pentamerone, ii. I, we have a variation of the other Ãsopian
fable of the lion who is afraid of the ass. The old witch, in order to
deliver herself from the lion which Petrosinella has caused to rise,
flays an ass and dresses herself in its skin; the lion, believing it to
be really an ass, runs off.–In the thirteenth of the Sicilian stories
collected by Signora Laura Gonzenbach, and published at Leipzig by
Brockhaus, the ass and the lion dispute the spoil; the young hero
divides it, giving to the ass the hay that the lion has in its mouth,
and to the lion the bones in the ass's mouth. But probably the lion here
represents the dog, according to the Greek proverb, "KÃ¼ni didÃ´s achÃ¼ra,
onÃ´i ta ostea," to express a thing done the wrong way. [743] In the

[744] Cfr. the first
of the Novelline di Santo Stefano di Calcinaia, in which we
also find the third brother, believed to be stupid, who makes his ass
throw gold from its tail; the foolish Pimpi, who kills his ass whilst
cutting wood; the son of the poor man, who amuses himself by sending the
ass before him tied to a string, and then making it return; the peasant
who drags up the ass which had fallen into the marsh, and who then
marries the daughter of the king of Russia (the wintry, the gloomy, the
nocturnal one), who never laughed and whom he causes to laugh; and the
ass who dies after eating a poisoned loaf. [745] Contes et
