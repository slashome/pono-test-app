[781] We also find the
lame goat, or he-goat, in the legend of Thor. The god kills his
he-goats, takes off their skins, and keeps their bones, to be able to
resuscitate them at pleasure. His son, Thialfi, steals the thigh-bone of
one of the goats, in order to go and sell it; then one of the he-goats
of Thor, being resuscitated, is lame.–Cfr. for the analogous traditions
