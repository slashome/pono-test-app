the Khorda Avesta, Spiegel's Einleitung, p. 54: "Dort
ist der dreibeinige Esel der in der Mitte des Sees steht und mit seinem
Geschrei die bÃ¶sen Wesen vertreibt und alles Wasser, das mit unreinen
Wesen und Dingen in BerÃ¼hrung kommt, sogleich reinigt."

[720] Readers of Dante
are acquainted with the trumpet of the devil Malacoda, which is used in
the same way as the fool uses his in the Mongol story. [721] In Menander,
quoted by Aulus Gellius, a husband complains of the injuries done him by
his wife, using the proverb, "The ass amongst the monkeys." Monkeys are
well known for their impudent lasciviousness; the ass, who represents
the phallos, among this lascivious fraternity finds himself often in the
condition of an impotent and weak husband. [722]
