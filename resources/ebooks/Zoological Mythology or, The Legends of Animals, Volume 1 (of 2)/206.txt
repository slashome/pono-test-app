Apta asini flammis indicis exta damus. Quem tu diva memor de pane monilibus
ornas;

Cessat opus; vacuÃ¦ conticuere molÃ¦. –Ovidius, Fasti, vi. [723] From the myth of
the ass, as a musician and judge of music, is derived the Tuscan game of
the ass, which is thus described by Signor Fanfani in his
Vocabolario dell' Uso Tuscano, Firenze, 1863:–"Each member of
the party chooses an animal whose voice or song he must imitate. The
head player represents the ass, and is the king of the other animals. When the head player, sitting in the middle, calls one of the animals
who encircle him, the dog, for instance, this animal must bark; when he
calls the cock, it must cry chicchiricÃ¹; when he calls the ox, he who
represents it must bellow, and so on. When the ass brays, then all the
animals emit their respective cries. Whoever laughs, or omits to give
forth the voice or song of the animal which he represents, pays a
forfeit."

Metam. xi.
