Afanassieff, v. 7, where the rogue passes the she-goat off as
his sister, and lets her be killed, in order to oblige the murderer, by
threats of exposure, to give him a large sum of money in compensation;
and v. 52, where the head of a goat is cut off to conceal the murder of
a sacristan, committed by the foolish third brother.–Cfr. Erlenwein, 17. [773] The she-goat is
also sacrificed, in the eighth of the Sicilian stories collected by
Laura Gonzenbach, to test the virtue of a truthful peasant. The wife of
a minister who is jealous of the peasant VeritÃ  (Truth), who has the
custody of a goat, a lamb, a ram, and a wether belonging to the king,
persuades him to believe that her life is forfeit, and can be ransomed
only by the sacrifice of the wether. The peasant, overcome partly by
love and partly by compassion, gives way and consents to the sacrifice. The minister hopes that the peasant will conceal his fault, but is
disappointed in his expectation, inasmuch as, on the contrary, he
ingenuously confesses everything; and he becomes, in consequence, yet
dearer to the king. [774] The devil also
presents himself to do his evil deeds in the BÃ©lier de
Rochefort, in Bonnafoux, LÃ©gendes et Croyances Superstitieuses
ConservÃ©es dans le DÃ©partment de la Creuse, Gueret, 1867, p. 17.–In
a legend of Baden, too, recorded by Simrock (work quoted before, p. 260;
cfr., in the same work, p. 501), the devil appears with the feet of a
he-goat. [775] vii. 50, 1.–In
the Classical Dictionary of Natural History of Audouin,
Bourdon, &c., first Italian translation, Venice, Tasso, 1831,
we read: "Goat, species of ophidian reptiles, indigenous in Congo, and
also in Bengal; as yet unclassified by zoologists, and which, it is
said, throw from afar a kind of saliva causing blindness."
