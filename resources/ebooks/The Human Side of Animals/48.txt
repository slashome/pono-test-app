They often played by running races together, the
deer would leap over the fence and the dog would chase him with great
delight. Surely, they must have had a spoken common language! No one claims that in the language of animals there are principles of

means those whose language is only a "bar-bar," and this is really all

cats, the bleating of sheep, the lowing of cows, the chattering of
monkeys and baboons is nothing more nor less than their language.
