G. Wood said: "Much of the present heedlessness
respecting animals is caused by the popular idea that they have no
souls, and that when they die they entirely perish. Whence came that
most preposterous idea? Surely not from the only source where we might
expect to
learn about souls–not from the Bible, for there we distinctly read of
'the spirit of the sons of man,' and immediately afterwards of 'the
spirit of the beasts,' one aspiring, the other not so. And a necessary
consequence of the spirit is a life after the death of the body. Let any
one wait in a frequented thoroughfare for one short hour, and watch the
sufferings of the poor brutes that pass by. Then, unless he denies the
Divine Providence, he will see clearly that unless these poor creatures
were compensated in a future life, there is no such quality as
justice."

Eugene T. Zimmerman says: "I cannot help but think that my faithful
dog, and playmate of my younger days, will have some form of a future
life."

We do not recognise an absolute spiritual barrier of separation
between man and animals. Man is an animal–the first of animals; but it
does not of necessity follow that he will always continue to be so. By
what right does he presume to deny a soul and a continued spiritual
existence to lower animals? Are we not all of us fellows and co-workers,
partakers of the same universal life, sharing alike a common source and
destiny?
