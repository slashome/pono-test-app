From this chamber a long winding tunnel
terminates very near the surface of the ground, and it is a long
distance from the other burrows. No sign of its existence appears from
above the surface of the earth, but if an enemy invades the burrow, away
the jerboas rush for this secret exit and break through to the surface
out of reach of the trouble, and escape. These African jerboas are exceedingly odd in
appearance, and they are two-legged in their habits of walk, and never
go on all-fours. They walk by placing one hind foot alternately before
the other; and they run in the same way.
