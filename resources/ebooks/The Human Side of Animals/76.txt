They demonstrate the
ability to plan for the future, and meet all emergencies. Certain food hoarders and robbers, like the vole, are so very greedy
and become such misers that they
often threaten total destruction to large areas of grain. They were so
plentiful in the classic land of Thessaly, the vale of Tempe, and the
Land of Olympus that the old Greeks established what they called an
Apollo Smintheus, the Mouse-destroying God. In the early spring,
according to Professor Loeffler, who has made a special study of their
invasions, they begin to come down from their homes in the hills to the
cultivated fields. They seem to follow regular roads, and often travel
along the railroad embankment. They travel very slowly, and when at home
live somewhat on the order of prairie dogs, that is, in underground
dwellings with numerous winding passages and tunnels. These wise little food conservers are nocturnal in habit, and are
rarely seen except by careful observers. When they once determine to rob
a field, they do it with amazing rapidity and completeness. In a single
night hordes of these workers go into a cornfield and by daylight not a
stalk of corn remains. The field is as empty as if a cyclone had struck
it. They work with great system, and while a part of their number cut
the stalks down, others cut it up into movable sizes, while still others
superintend its systematic removal. Storehouses are usually provided
before the grain is even cut. They make long voyages throughout a
country, storing away
tons of grain and food in these various granaries.
