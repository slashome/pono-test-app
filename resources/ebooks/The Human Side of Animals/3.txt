ILLUSTRATIONS

Recreation is as common among animals as
it is among children (in Colours)

Frontispiece

The Indians claim that the mother bison
forced her calf to roll often in a puddle of red clay, so that it might
be indistinguishable against its clay background

The zebra is one of the cleverest of
camouflagers. The black-and-white stripes of his body give the effect of
sunlight passing through bushes

Monkeys are the most musical of all
animals. When they congregate for "concerts," as some of the tribes do,
the air is filled with weird strains of monkey-music

20

Cats, unlike dogs, are very fond of music. And it has been proved that their music-sense can be developed to a
remarkable degree

21

A happy family of polar bears. The young
cubs wrestle and tumble, as playfully as two puppies. This play has much
to do with their physical and mental development

34

Dryptosaurus. The prehistoric animals,
too, undoubtedly had their play time, with games and "setting up"
exercises

35

The mother opossum is never happier than
when she has her little ones playing hide-and-seek over her back

38

This young fox came from his home in the
woods daily to play with a young fox-terrier. He is now resting after a
romp

39

Naosaurus and Dimetrodon, two extinct
armour-bearers who should have been well able to protect themselves

50

An armour-bearer of prehistoric times
whose shield was an effective protection against enemy horns

51

To the polar bear the ice and snow of the
Far North means warmth and protection. The mother bear digs herself into
a snowbank, where lives quite comfortably throughout the winter

84

The sharp claws of the ground squirrel are
efficacious tools in digging his cosy underground burrow

85

The coyote can readily distinguish whether
a herd of sheep is guarded by one or more dogs, and will plan his attack
accordingly

94

The zebu, the sacred bull of India, in
spite of its domestication, has an agile body and a quick, alert
mind

95

Roosevelt's Colobus. These horse-tailed
monkeys chatter together in a language exclusively their own, yet they
seem to have no difficulty in making themselves understood by other
monkey-tribes

112

A tamed deer of Texas, whose constant
companion and playmate was a rabbit dog. Between the two, there
developed, necessarily, a common language

113

Water-loving animals, like the beavers,
seemingly take great pride in their toilets. Their fur is always sleek
and clean

122

Great forest pigs of Central Africa. Like
the common domesticated hogs, they will seek a clay bath to heal their
wounds

123

The Rocky Mountain goat has many means of
defence, not the least of which is his agility in climbing to
inaccessible places

134

Wild boars are among the most ferocious of
animals. By means of their great strength alone they are well able to
defend themselves

135

Brontosaurus. The animals that seemed best
equipped to defend themselves are the ones that, thousands of years ago,
became extinct

144

This prehistoric monster was equipped not
only with a pair of strong horns but with a shield back of them as
well

145

The beaver is the greatest of all animal
architects. His skill is equalled only by his patience (in Colours)

158

The skunk mother tries to keep on hand a
good supply of such delicacies as frogs and toads, so that her young may
never go hungry

172

The porcupine and the hedgehog have a
unique method of collecting food for their young. After shaking down
berries or grapes, they roll in them, then hurry home with the food
attached to their quills

173

The black bear is not one of the great
migrating animals. The thickness of his coat must therefore change with
the seasons

188

Rabbits seem to have a well-devised system
in their road-building, running their paths in and out of underbrush in
a truly ingenious manner

189

The mongoose, a scavenger of the worst
type, feeding on rats and mice and snakes, and even poultry

202

Diplodocus. The prehistoric animals, also,
undoubtedly had their scavengers and criminals

203

The Esquimo-dog is man's greatest friend
in the Far North

218

Chipmunks are among the most easily tamed
of man's wild friends, and they even seem fond of human
companionship

219

Men cruelly take the lives of these
denizens of the wildwood, rejoicing in their slaughter, but the animal
soul they cannot kill

244

Two pals. There is between man and dog a
kinship of spirit that cannot be denied

245

FOREWORD

"And in the lion or the
frog–

In all the life of moor or
fen–

In ass and peacock, stork and
dog,

He read similitudes of
men."

More and more science is being taught in a new way. More and more men
are beginning to discard the lumber of the brain's workshop to get at
real facts, real conclusions.
