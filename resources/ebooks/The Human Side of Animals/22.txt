Immediately he poked his
head out, and then his feet, and then he began to wave his feet wildly
in air, and finally threw himself in the right position and hastened
away through the grass. The turtle protects himself in the same way, and draws his head,
feet, and tail under his own house-roof where nothing can get him. Lobsters and crabs are excellent types of armour-bearing animals. Lobsters wear marvellous coats of mail, very similar to those worn by
human warriors during the age of chivalry. Their jointed structure
assures them perfect ease and security. Crabs, however, believe, as the
tortoise, in the strong-box protection. When resting, crabs tuck their
legs beneath them, so as to shelter themselves under the hard covering. Upon crabs Nature has bestowed twin protective characteristics: namely,
they are armoured, and also mimic their surroundings. The latter
protection is especially needful, because certain big fishes, like the
cod, are in the habit of swallowing crabs whole. In this case the armour
is of no use, while the protective resemblance saves the crab. To discuss in detail all the various kinds of armour and mail that
the different groups of animals have used and developed for offensive
and defensive
purposes since the days of the prehistoric gigantic armadillos to the
present, would require a book of itself. It is sufficient to know that
armour and mail and spines are among Nature's most common forms of
protection, and that each age develops new and ever more efficient
methods of defence. This simply means that the age-long drama of
evolution is always changing.
