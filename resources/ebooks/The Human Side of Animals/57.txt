Even fish are capable
of reaching their prey at a long distance. The toxotes
jaculator, which lives in the rivers of India, and feeds upon
insects, cannot afford to wait until the insects which thrive upon the
leaves of aquatic plants fall into the water. So as he cannot leap high
enough to catch them, he fills his mouth with water and squirts it at an
insect with such aim and force that he rarely fails to knock the insect
into the water where he can easily catch it. Many other animals squirt
various liquids, occasionally in attack, but most times in defence. The
fish makes a veritable squirt-gun of his mouth. Beavers use sticks, chips, and even stones in building their dams;
and their engineering abilities are astounding. They are also capable of
meeting emergencies, as shown by the following incident. A farmer in
Michigan discovered one morning, just after a flood, that all his potato
sacks, which had been hung on a back fence to dry, had suddenly
disappeared. A few days later he found them in a nearby beavers' colony,
used in rebuilding their dam, which had suddenly overflowed.
