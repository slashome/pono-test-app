If four
dogs attack it, they are counted and the tactics used that would be
useless in other cases. If four dogs attack, two on each
side, it retreats, with face toward the enemy. If a dozen dogs are in
the attacking force, the hog becomes confused, loses all idea of number,
and wildly bites at any enemy that comes nearest. Man in a similar
condition would use practically the same tactics. Cats undeniably count their kittens. If the mother loses one of three
or four, she searches for it immediately. When dogs are chasing a hare,
if they raise another, they become very confused, as if they did not
know which to follow.
