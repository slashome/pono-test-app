No doubt the darkness gives them
a sense of security which aids their work. Anyway, in the completed job,
we see the evidences of a skilled engineer and architect, and one who
knew thoroughly what he was about. The size of a dam depends entirely upon the wishes of its builders
and location and general conditions of land and water. Sometimes the
more ambitious beavers build a dam a quarter of a mile in length. They
employ exactly the same principle as is used in making a mill-dam. Beavers, however, were building dams long before millers came into
existence, and their methods are fully as scientific as those of man. Mill-dams usually run straight across a stream, while beaver-dams are so
curved that the water is gently turned to each side. In this way the
beaver-dams are capable of resisting immense quantities of water which
in its impetuous rush would carry away the ordinary mill-dam. Many
scientific thinkers claim that the beaver employs this principle of
construction without knowing it. How absurd!
