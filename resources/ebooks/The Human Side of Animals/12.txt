Everywhere does
Nature aid in escape and capture. Only those skilled in the ways of the
wild fully realise how conspicuous amidst foliage, for instance, would
be a uniform colouration. A parti-coloured pattern is extremely
deceptive and thus protective, and for this reason one seldom sees in
Nature a background of one colour; and since the large majority of
animals need concealment, it is necessary for them to be clothed in
patterns that vary. These variations are especially noticeable in young animals, and
furnish them with a mantle that is practically invisible to predatory
enemies during the time they are left unprotected by their parents. These protective mantles often differ strikingly in pattern and
colouration from those of
their parents, and indicate that the young animals present the
colouration and pattern of their remote forbears. It might even be said
that "the skins of the fathers are thrust upon the children, even unto
the third and fourth generation!" In fact, it is quite probable that
they give through this varying colouration the "life-history" of their
family. In all hoofed animals–antelope, deer, horses–the protective
colouration is also adapted to habitat and environment. Most deer belong
to the forest, carefully avoiding the open deserts and staying near
water. They live chiefly in the jungle or scrub, and are usually spotted
with red and white in such a way as to be almost invisible to a casual
observer; some, however, that live in the very shady places are
uniformly dark so as to harmonise with their surroundings. The wild
horses and asses of Central Asia are dun-coloured–corresponding exactly
to their sandy habitat. The Shakesperian conception of the human world as a stage may be
paralleled in the animal world. Animals, like human beings, have all a
definite rÃ´le to play in the drama of life. Each is given certain
equipment in form, colour, voice, demeanour, ambitions, desires, and
natural habitat.
