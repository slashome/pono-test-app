Who can say that from the depths of the wide ocean, from regions
unknown, and lands unexplored by man; from the remotest islands of the
sea, and even from the far icy North, there are not animal voices ever
rising in praise of our common Creator? The Bible says: "The Lord is
good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works," and, "All
Thy works shall praise thee, O Lord,"–surely these endorse the above
statements. And why should man define the limit of God's goodness, His
love, care, and attention to the wants and needs of all His
creatures? The distinguished animal authority, Dr. Abercrombie, admitted that
animals have an "immaterial principle" in them, which is distinct from
matter. But he does not say that this principle, or soul, will live
after death, as it is supposed to in man. However, many scholars both of
ancient and modern times hold this opinion. Broderip, in his
Zoological Recreations devotes much space in referring to
ancient philosophers and poets, Christian Fathers, and Jewish Rabbis
that have believed in the immortality of animals. The heroes of Virgil
have horses to drive in the Elysian fields; the Greek poets gave to
Orion dogs. Rabbi Manesseh, speaking of the resurrection, says, "brutes
will then enjoy a much happier state of being than they experienced
here," and a number of scholars, like Philo JudÃ¦us, believe that
ferocious beasts will in a future state lose their ferociousness. Among
more recent scholars who hold this belief is Dr. John Brown, who boldly
says: "I am one of those who believe that dogs have a next world; and
why not?" The Rev. J.
