After he had progressed to ten, he might begin addition. At least the
experiment would be interesting and conducive to learning the truth. Surely a knowledge of mathematics is no more wonderful than that of the
ordinary pointer dog's ability to distinguish different kinds of birds. Certain of those wise dogs are trained to hunt only quail, while others
hunt several varieties of game. It should be remembered that all degrees of arithmetical aptitude are
found in the human races, from the genius of a Newton and a Laplace to
the absolute inability of certain of the Hottentots to count to three. These inequalities in the mathematical notions of different people
should make us very cautious about saying that animals cannot count and
have no sense of numbers. It is extremely probable that if we had a way
of choosing those
animals with a special gift for arithmetic, they would surprise us with
their learning. COYOTE

THE COYOTE
CAN READILY DISTINGUISH WHETHER A HERD OF SHEEP IS GUARDED BY ONE OR
MORE DOGS, AND WILL PLAN HIS ATTACK ACCORDINGLY. ZEBU

THE ZEBU,
THE SACKED BULL OF INDIA, IN SPITE OF ITS DOMESTICATION, HAS AN AGILE
BODY AND A QUICK, ALERT MIND. No one denies that animals are capable of distinguishing relative
sizes and even quantities. They are not so skilled as the average human
being in making these distinctions, yet when mentally compared to the
state of Bushmen, Tasmanians, and Veddahs, who can count only two, and
call it many, there is not such a vast gulf between them and
mankind. The zebu, or sacred bull of India, shows his mathematical qualities
to a pronounced degree. When he grows attached to a small group of his
kin, he will often refuse to leave them unless the entire group
accompany him.
