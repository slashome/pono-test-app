Only after the music had ceased did he resume his normal
position. The Indians agree that under the influence of various musical
instruments, especially bagpipes, snake-charmers are able to get the
snakes to come out from their homes among the old rocks and
walls, and when they appear they seem perfectly dazed so that they can
be easily captured. It is not well to have any kind of musical instrument played, when in
a forest at night where there are dangerous snakes, lest they come to
hear it. Snake-hunters always carry with them some kind of musical
instrument, depending upon the kind of snakes they wish to capture. It
seems that all are not equally fascinated by it. I have experimented
with little effect upon a large rattler; it may have been that he was
deaf. But he gave little evidence of being interested. We need not feel humiliated, then, for our animal kinspeople with
their primitive music: we were monkeys, and before them we were
reptiles, birds, fishes, even worms. But that was ages ago, and we have
grown up and become better musicians. Evolution has chosen us as its
favourites and given us every advantage in the struggle up the ladder of
life. Our musical rivals of yesterday are as chorus people compared to
Metropolitan Opera stars, with us. On this earth we reign supreme, we
have conquered the earth, air, and water, annihilating time and
distance.
