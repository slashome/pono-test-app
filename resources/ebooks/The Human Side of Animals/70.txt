Perhaps this is to her heart genuine music,
and his faithful attention to their children makes up for his love of
idleness! Perhaps the strangest animal engineer in the world is found in
Madagascar and Australia. It is the duckbill or duckmole, and is
scientifically known as the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus. The
natives of Australia call it by several names: Mallangong,
Tambreet, and not a few call it, Tohunbuck. This odd little aquatic engineer digs long tunnels of great intricacy
in the bands of lazy rivers, and because of its paradoxical nature and
appearance has caused many strange stories to originate about its habits
and methods of propagation. It has the beak of a duck and waddles not
unlike this bird, but, like other mammals, it gives birth to its young,
and does not lay eggs, as is so often claimed for it. When swimming it
looks like a bunch of floating weeds or grass. Its home is always on the banks of a stream, and is always provided
with two entrances: one below the surface of the water, and the other
above.
