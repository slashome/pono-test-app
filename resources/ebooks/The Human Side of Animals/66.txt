They can leap an extraordinary
distance. Frogs and toads, as a class, are not so skilled in house-building as
some of their higher relations, but there is one of their number–the
Hyla faber–that is remarkably gifted in building mud houses. He
lives in Brazil, and the natives call him the ferreiro, or
smith, and he is indeed the master-builder of his family. Mrs. Hyla is
really the gifted member of the tribe, and it is during the breeding
season that she diligently dives underneath the water, digs up handfuls
of mud, and builds on the bottom a small circular wall, which encloses a
space about ten to fourteen inches in diameter. This wall is continued
until it reaches about four inches above the surface of the water.
