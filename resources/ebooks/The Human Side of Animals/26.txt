The
complex chambers and circular galleries do justice to an artist. The
space of
ground covered by a single mole's roads and galleries is almost

sunk at various depths, according to the condition of the mole's
hunting-grounds, which are really the spaces of ground through which he
tunnels. Worms and underground insects are his chief food.
