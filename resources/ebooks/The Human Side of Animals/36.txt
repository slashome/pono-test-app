Many savages, for example,
cannot count beyond three or four. Sir John
Lubbock gives an anecdote of Mr. Galton, who compared the arithmetical
knowledge of certain savages of South Africa and a dog. The comparison
proved to the advantage of the dog. There is no reason that a dog should not be taught arithmetic. And if
one wishes to do so, it might be well to begin by making the dog
distinguish one from two, allowing him to touch both once at the word
one, and twice at the word two. Then he might pass on to six or seven.
