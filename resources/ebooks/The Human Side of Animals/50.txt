She had come and
told us her troubles and got aid. Cats are gifted linguists. By mewing they can just as plainly express
a desire to have a door
opened or closed as if they requested it in so many words. A friend has
furnished me with an interesting account of her cat's ability to make
herself understood. It seems that the cat, with her three small kittens,
at one time slept in a box prepared for her in the kitchen. But one
night when it was particularly cold, some one left the kitchen window
open, and late in the night the cat went to her mistress's bed and mewed
continuously until her mistress arose and went to the kitchen and closed
the window. The cat was perfectly satisfied, as she had made her great
need understood. The ability that animals have to make their own language understood
by man is not the only linguistic power they possess; as already
mentioned, they are also capable of understanding something of human
speech. There is no doubt that all domesticated animals understand the
human language; the horse, dog, ox, and sheep comprehend a large part of
what is said to them, though of course they may not understand the
precise words used. I once owned a rabbit dog, "Nimrod," and if he never understood
another word of the English language, there is no doubt that he knew
what the word "rabbit" meant. No matter in what manner or way I used the
word, Nimrod was ready for a hunt, and
yelped with glee at the thought of the chase that he was to have.
