This has always been the faith and insight of the child, whose
simple wisdom we ever turn to for truth and guidance. And in our clearer realisation of the oneness of all life, we will
extend to all creatures the Golden Rule, showing them the love and
consideration we would have shown to us. The HUMAN
SIDE of BIRDS. By ROYAL DIXON

With 4 illustrations in color and 32 in black-and-white. Cloth,
8vo. With every statement based on fact, and every fact of unusual
interest, the author shows that many qualities of and occupations in the
human world have their parallels in the bird world. Here is bird study from a new angleâ€“instead of treating our bird
neighbors as labeled specimens to be described in scientific terms, they
are treated as friends, and a careful study is made of their
disposition, character, emotions and "thought processes."

Mr. Dixon tells of birds who are policemen, athletes, divers, bakers;
birds who maintain courts of justice and military organizations and many
other curious types. BUY FROM
