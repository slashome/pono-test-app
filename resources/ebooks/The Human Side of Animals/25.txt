Mr. Wood has verified the observation that around the
keep are two circular passages, one of which is level with the ceiling,
while the other is above. The upper
circle is decidedly smaller than the lower; and there are five ascending
passages which connect the galleries with each other. There is only one
entrance, however, and from it three roads lead into the upper part of
the keep. When a mole enters the house from one of the tunnels, he must
go through the basement in order to get to the upper part of the house
and so descend into the keep. There is still another entrance into the
keep from below. One passage leads downward directly from the middle of
the chamber, then curving upward, leads into a larger tunnel or
subway. Throughout the vast network of tunnels every inch of wall space seems
quite smooth and polished. This is due to the continuous pressure of the
mole's fur against the walls. Thus there is little danger of the walls
collapsing even after a rain-storm. No human being knows just why the
mole has such a complex system of underground streets and tunnels;
perhaps it is because he finds that a greater feeling of safety
surrounds his home when he knows that in case of danger he can escape in
a dozen directions. Surely he is the original builder of labyrinths! How marvellous that so tiny a creature can build such a fortress!
