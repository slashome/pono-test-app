This is dumbfounding to other
animals. Of course, their intelligent and quick-witted methods of
defence, menace, guard-duty, and loyalty to tribe makes them great
warriors, and enables them to survive even the onslaughts of their
greatest enemy and nightmare of every non-carnivorous animalâ€“the harpy
eagle! Through the necessary adjustments growing out of the close
relationships of men to animals, the mental faculties of both have been
greatly stimulated and advanced. The least developed races seem
to be in such places as Tierra del Fuego, where there are no savage
animals, and, therefore, no inducement for man to arm and defend
himself. The Pygmies of Central Africa are mighty hunters, otherwise
they could not survive.
