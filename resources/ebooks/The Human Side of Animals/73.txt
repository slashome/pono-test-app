and Mrs. Pole-cat can then visit or hunt as they please, so long as their
children have plenty of fresh meat at home! Another interesting food conserver is the chipping squirrel, or
chipmunk, so named because his cry sounds like the chirp of little
chickens. His method of dress is most unusual; he is brownish grey
in colour, with five stripes of black and two of pale yellow running
along the back of his coat; the throat and lower part of his body is
snowy white. These colours occasionally vary, when the grey and yellow
are superseded by black. His home is underground, usually under an old wall, near a rock
fence, or under a tree; his burrow is so long and winding that he can
easily escape almost any enemy, except the weasel, which is not easily
outwitted. His nursery and living-room is quite pretentious, but his
lateral storeroom is a marvel! He is a miser indeed, and stores up every
acorn and nut he can find, even many times more than he can ever eat. His variety of food is almost unending–he loves buckwheat, beaked nuts,
pecans, various kinds of grass seeds, and Indian corn. In carrying food
to his home he first fills his pouches to overflowing and then takes
another nut in his mouth; he thus reminds the classical reader of
AlemÃ¦on in the treasury of CrÅ“sus. The hedgehog is a regular Solomon in her methods of collecting fruit. Plutarch had a very high opinion of her. He says that when grapes are
ripe, the mother hedgehog goes under the vines and shakes them until
some of the grapes fall; she then literally rolls over them until many
are attached to her spines, and marches back to her babies in the
cave. "One day," says Plutarch, "when we were all together, we had the
chance of seeing this with our own eyes–it looked as if a bunch of
grapes was shuffling along the ground, so thickly covered was the animal
with its booty."

MOTHER TRIES TO KEEP ON HAND A GOOD SUPPLY OF SUCH DELICACIES AS FROGS
AND TOADS, SO THAT HER YOUNG MAY NEVER GO HUNGRY. PORCUPINE

THE
PORCUPINE AND THE HEDGEHOG HAVE A UNIQUE METHOD OF COLLECTING FOOD FOR
THEIR YOUNG. AFTER SHAKING DOWN BERRIES OR GRAPES, THEY ROLL IN THEM,
THEN HURRY HOME WITH THE FOOD ATTACHED TO THEIR QUILLS. Alpine mice not only form comfortable winter homes in the earth, but
combine into small winter colonies, each colony numbering about ten to
twelve inhabitants, all of whom are under the direction of a leader. Thus organised, they proceed to lay up provisions for the winter. They
use their mouths as scythes and their paws as rotary machines.
