Sometimes they
steal a baby, never killing it outright, but carrying it away to their
dens to starve it to death before
mutilating its body. If the courage of this beast equalled his strength,
he would be the despot of the desert. But he is like his fellow workman,
the jackal, cowardly to the last degree. Neither of them ever attempts to put an enemy to flight by legitimate
means. They resort to fakery: one howls, and the other wrinkles his face
in great anger. The jackal's greatest asset and protection, when he
meets with an enemy, is bluff. He raises his ugly mane, lifts his
ungainly shoulders and assumes the look of a Jason, while in reality he
is as harmless as a mouse, and the smallest child could drive him away
with a twig.
