It is only a matter of time until many animals will understand the
use of man-made tools. Some have already learned to use such tools as
they make and shape for themselves. Monkeys and apes are already gifted
in this art. Of course, under domestication, they use knives, forks,
spoons, and dishes not so much from intelligence as from imitation. This, however, might be said of many human beings. I have seen an
immense chimpanzee sit in a chair, set his own dinner table, use his
knife and fork correctly when eating, and take great delight in the use
of his napkin, which he always carefully refolded when his meal was
over. The human-like qualities of apes and monkeys, however, need scarcely
be told. They are so very similar to man in most ways that there are few
things they cannot do. Aelian tells of an ape which
learned to drive horses skilfully. He knew just when and how to use the
whip, how much slack to allow in the reins, and when to tighten them! They greatly resent any intrusion on their hunting-grounds, and make use
of sticks and clubs to protect them.
