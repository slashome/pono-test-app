At the first sign of dawn, they disappear like rats
from a burning building, and seek their caves to digest their ignoble
banquets. No human street-cleaner could ever excel their work. No matter how
large the garbage pile, no matter how many dead dogs, cats, and donkeys
in a village street, no matter how unspeakable the offal, it all
vanishes as completely as though it had been burned.
