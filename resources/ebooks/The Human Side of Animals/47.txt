We knew
that its mother was not far away, and so we placed salt and food just
where the baby was found, to attract the mother's attention. In a few
days, we saw the mother, and shortly afterwards five grown deer were
seen eating the food we had placed for the mother. Evidently the news
had been carried through the pine forests that it was safe for deer to
come near our home. My sister's pet grew rapidly, and became a great
friend of our yard dog.
