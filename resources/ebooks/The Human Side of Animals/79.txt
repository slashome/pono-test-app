They take life easy, and sometimes during their journeys
select a suitable spot near the seashore and have a real picnic. A scout
has already discovered the right spot for getting big oysters, of which
they are exceedingly fond, and when they have assembled, certain ones
proceed to dig up the oysters, which they hand to others on the shore
and they, in turn, place them on
big stones, and proceed to open them for the feast. If one of the
fishermen-monkeys discovers an oyster open, he will not insert his hand
to remove the meat until first placing a stone between the valves. This
assures him protection against the closing of the oyster. In most cases,
they open the oysters by first placing them on stones and then using
another stone as a hammer. These facts are vouched for by no less
authorities than Gamelli Carreri, Dampier, and Wafer.
