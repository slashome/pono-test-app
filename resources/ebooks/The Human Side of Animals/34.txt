This went on for some months, and we could make nothing of it. Well, one
day I was walking across the Grass-market, with Wylie at my heels, when
two shepherds
started, and looking at her, one said, 'That's her; that's the wonderful
wise bitch that naebody kens.' I asked him what he meant, and he told me
that for months past she had made her appearance by the first daylight
at the 'buchts' or sheep-pens in the cattle-market, and worked
incessantly, and to excellent purpose, in helping the shepherds to get
their sheep and lambs in. The man said in a sort of transport, 'She's a
perfect meeracle; flees about like a speerit, and never gangs wrang;
wears, but never grups, and beats a' oor dowgs. She's a perfect
meeracle, and as soople as a mawkin'.' She continued this work until she
died."

Another most striking instance, showing animals' sense of time, is
that related by Watson in which he tells of two friends, fathers of
families, one living in London and the other at Guilford. For many years
it was the custom of the London family to visit their friends in
Guilford, always accompanied by their spaniel, CÃ¦sar.
