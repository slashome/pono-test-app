Imagine
him the size of a wild cat! He would be a beast of exceeding ferocity. Even a lion would find him a formidable antagonist. With such an animal
tunnelling in his fields and cellars, man would have a terror hard to
exterminate. The mole is an engineer and miner who seems to have a strange sense
of direction practically unknown to many other animals. How he manages
to form tunnels and burrows in lines of such unusual straightness is
unknown; he always works in darkness, unless it is that he can see in
the dark. His little hills are not deliberate structures; they are only
shaft ends through which this miner throws out the earth that he has
scooped from subterranean depths, and in most cases smoothed out so that
if an observer examines the burrow he will find only solid earth, and a
road into his tunnel which leads to his real habitation. The home of the mole is usually beneath a tree or hillock, and
reminds one of a miniature city of tunnels and engineering feats. The
main, or central, room is shaped like a great dome, the upper part of
which is level with the earth around the hill, and therefore nowhere
near its apex.
