The Goat

A gentleman who had taken an active share in the rebellion of 1715,
after the battle of Preston escaped into the West Highlands, where a
lady, a near relative, afforded him an asylum. A faithful servant
conducted him to the mouth of a cave, and furnished him with an abundant
store of provisions.
