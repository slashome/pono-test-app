Fox Chasing

During a fox hunt, Reynard, being hard pressed, was reduced to the
necessity of taking refuge up a chimney of a hothouse. He was followed
by one of the hounds, who, passing through a flue upwards of fifty feet
in length, came out at the top of the chimney, but missed Reynard in its
murky recess. By this time a number of people were collected at the top
of the chimney, who let down a terrier, who soon made him come in view,
holding fast by his brush.
