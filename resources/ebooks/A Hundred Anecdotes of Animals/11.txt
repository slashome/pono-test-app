Anecdote XXXIX. Long Lost Found Again

A female elephant belonging to a gentleman at Calcutta broke loose
from her keeper, and was lost in the woods. The excuses which the keeper
made were not admitted. It was supposed that he had sold the elephant;
his wife and family therefore were sold for slaves, and he was himself
condemned to work upon the roads. About twelve years after, this man was
ordered into the country to assist in catching wild elephants. The
keeper fancied he saw his long-lost elephant in a group that was before
them. He was determined to go up to it; nor could the strongest
representations of the danger dissuade him from his purpose. When he
approached the creature, she knew him, and giving him three salutes, by
waving her trunk in the air, knelt down and received him on her back. She afterwards assisted in securing the other elephants, and likewise
brought her three young ones. The keeper recovered his character; and,
as a recompense for his sufferings and intrepidity, had an annuity
settled on him for life. This elephant was afterwards in the possession
of Governor Hastings.
