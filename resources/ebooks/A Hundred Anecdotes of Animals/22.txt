Sonnini, when in Egypt, had an Angora cat, of which he was
extremely fond. It was entirely covered with long white silken hairs;
its tail formed a magnificent plume, which the animal elevated at
pleasure over its body. Not one spot, nor a single dark shade, tarnished
the dazzling white of its coat. Its nose and lips were of a delicate
rose colour. Two large eyes sparkled in its round head: one was of a
light yellow, and the other of a fine blue. This beautiful animal had even more loveliness of manners than grace
in its attitude and movements. However ill any one used her, she never
attempted to advance her claws from their sheaths. Sensible to kindness,
she licked the hand which caressed, and even that which tormented her. In Sonnini's solitary moments, she chiefly kept by his side; she
interrupted him often in the midst of his labours or meditations, by
little caresses extremely touching, and generally followed him in his
walks. During his absence she sought and called for him incessantly. She
recognised his voice at a distance, and seemed on each fresh meeting
with him to feel increased delight. This animal, says Sonnini, was my principal amusement for several
years. How was the expression of attachment depicted upon her
countenance! How many times have her caresses made me forget my
troubles, and consoled me in my misfortunes! My beautiful and
interesting companion, however, at length perished. After several days
of suffering, during which I never forsook her, her eyes, constantly
fixed on me, were at length extinguished; and her loss rent my heart
with sorrow.

Anecdote LXXV. Division of Labour

The Alpine marmots are said to act in concert in the collection of
materials for the construction of their habitations. Some of them, we
are told, cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set
serve as waggons to carry it to their holes; while others perform all
the functions of draught horses. The manner of the latter part of the
curious process is this. The animal who is to serve as the waggon lies
down on his back, and extending his four limbs as wide as he can, allows
himself to be loaded with hay; and those who are to be the draught
horses trail him thus loaded by the tail, taking care not to overset
him. The task of thus serving as the vehicle being evidently the least
enviable part of the business, is taken by every one of the party in
turn. image
