Anecdote III. Studying

A magpie, belonging to a barber at Rome, could imitate to a nicety
almost every word it heard. Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded
before the shop, and for a day or two afterwards the magpie was quite
mute, and seemed pensive and melancholy. All who knew it were greatly
surprised at its silence; and it was supposed that the sound of the
trumpets had so stunned it, as to deprive it at once of both voice and
hearing. It soon appeared, however, that this was far from being the
case; for the bird had been all the time occupied in profound
meditation, studying how to imitate the sound of the trumpets; and when
at last master of it, the magpie, to the astonishment of all its
friends, suddenly broke its long silence, by a perfect imitation of the
flourish of trumpets it had heard; observing with the greatest exactness
all the repetitions, stops, and changes. The acquisition of this lesson
had, however, exhausted the whole of the magpie's stock of intellect;
for it made it forget everything it had learned before. image
