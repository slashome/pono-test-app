The man's wife, who beheld the dreadful
scene, took her two children, and threw them at the feet of the enraged
animal, saying, Since you have slain my husband, take my life also, as
well as that of my children. The elephant instantly stopped, relented,
and as if stung with remorse, took up the eldest boy with his trunk,
placed him on its neck, adopted him for his cornack, and would
never afterwards allow any other person to mount it. image

Anecdote II. The Newfoundland Dog

One of the magistrates in Harbour Grace, in Newfoundland, had an old
dog of the regular web-footed species peculiar to that island, who was
in the habit of carrying a lantern before his master at night, as
steadily as the most attentive servant could do, stopping short when his
master made a stop, and proceeding when he saw him disposed to follow. If his master was absent from home, on the lantern being fixed to his
mouth, and the command given, Go fetch thy master, he would
immediately set off and proceed directly to the town, which lay at the
distance of more than a mile from the place of his master's residence:
he would then stop at the door of every house which he knew his master
was in the habit of frequenting, and laying down his lantern, growl and
strike the door, making all the noise in his power until it was opened;
if his master was not there, he would proceed farther in the same
manner, until he had found him. If he had accompanied him only once into
a house, this was sufficient to induce him to take that house in his
round.
