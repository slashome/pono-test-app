Billinghurst

Price 6s.Â Â Â Â  Foolscap 4to.Â Â Â Â  Price $1.50. Truth.–Is it not the duty of parents to make their
children acquainted with La Fontaine? Well, then, no better opportunity
of so doing could possibly be afforded them than is given by the new
Bodley Head edition. It is a metrical version of the time-honoured
favourites, and every fable has a picture filling the page opposite. The
child would be hard to please who did not find hours of amusement in the
artist's work alone.

Times.–It is pleasant to turn to a taking edition
of La Fontaine's Fables, with Mr. Billinghurst's exceedingly clever
drawings; he throws a world of expression into the faces of his
beasts.

Pall Mall.–There is some excellent drawing in the
handsome volume of One Hundred Fables of La Fontaine, for which Mr. Percy Billinghurst has done the pictures. His bold pencil gives
expression to original ideas, some of them wrought with skill, and all
with a correct eye to effect. For the drawings alone this handsome book
should be prized.

Daily Chronicle.–Turned out in a style which will
fascinate the young, the illustrations by Mr. Billinghurst are executed
in fine taste. His animals are real animals which will delight all who
look upon them.

British Weekly.–A most elegantly-bound collection
of well-known fables re-told in rhyme, and illustrated with many fine
and masterly drawings.

Bookman.–We have nothing but praise for Mr. Billinghurst's work.... We know no pictures of fable-beasts that we like
better. The whole arrangement of the book is excellent.
