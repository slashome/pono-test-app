Musical Mice

One rainy winter evening, as I was alone in my chamber, relates an
American gentleman, I took up my flute and commenced playing. In a few
minutes my attention was directed to a mouse that I saw creeping from a
hole, and advancing to the chair in which I was sitting. I ceased
playing, and it ran precipitately back to its hole; I began again
shortly afterwards, and was much surprised to see it reappear, and take
its old position. The appearance of the little animal was truly
delightful; it couched itself on the floor, shut its eyes, and appeared
in ecstasy; I ceased playing, and it instantly disappeared again. This
experiment I repeated frequently with the same success, observing that
it was always differently affected, as the music varied from the slow
and plaintive, to the brisk or lively. It finally went off, and all my
art could not entice it to return.
