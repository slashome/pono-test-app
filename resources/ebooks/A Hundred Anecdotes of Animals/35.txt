Mr. Billinghurst
lends most comical expression to the faces of the beasts. The fox with
the grapes, the dog with the shadow, the wolf with the lamb, are their
own dumb but eloquent interpreters. We even distinguish a gleam of
profound disgust in the eye of the snake biting at the file.

Daily News.–The seventeenth-century version of the
fables, by Sir Roger l'Estrange, with its pleasant quaintness of
language, lends itself, and how delightfully, to its setting of
illustration; and it would surely be a child hard to please who would
cavil at this book.

Daily Telegraph.–Mr. Percy Billinghurst's
illustrations are most happily conceived and executed, and Mr. Kenneth
Grahame's preface is amusing. But perhaps the most interesting feature
of the edition is the adoption of Sir Roger l'Estrange's
seventeenth-century version. Those to whom it is new will be surprised
at the charm which his quaint and vigorous diction adds to the
fables.

Scotsman.–The Fables of Ãsop' have seldom been
printed and adorned more handsomely.... The illustrations are full of
originality and humour.

Spectator.–Mr. Billinghurst's full-page
illustrations are well drawn, and full of a quaint humour very
appropriate to the subject. His beasts and birds are in truth animals;
but he has succeeded in giving them strongly marked characteristic
expressions. The picture of the fox and the crocodile discussing their
pedigrees is delightful.
