Humane Society

A large colony of rooks had resided many years in a grove on the
banks of a river. One serene evening the idle members amused themselves
with chasing each other through endless mazes, and in their flight they
made the air sound with an infinitude of discordant noises. In the midst
of these playful exertions it unfortunately happened that one rook, by a
sudden turn, struck his beak against the wing of another. The sufferer
instantly fell into the river. A general cry of distress ensued. The
birds hovered with every expression of anxiety over their distressed
companion. Animated by their sympathy, and perhaps by the language of counsel
known to themselves, he sprang into the air, and by one strong effort
reached the point of a rock that projected into the river. The joy
became loud and universal; but, alas! it was soon changed into notes of
lamentation, for the poor wounded bird, in attempting to fly towards his
nest, dropped again into the river and was drowned, amid the moans of
his whole fraternity. image
