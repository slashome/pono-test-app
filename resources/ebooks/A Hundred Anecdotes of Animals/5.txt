Making Sure

During the war between Augustus CÃ¦sar and Marc Antony, when all the
world stood wondering and uncertain which way Fortune would incline
herself, a poor man at Rome, in order to be prepared for making, in
either event, a bold hit for his own advancement, had recourse to the
following ingenious expedient. He applied himself to the training of two
crows with such diligence, that he brought them the length of
pronouncing with great distinctness, the one a salutation to CÃ¦sar, and
the other a salutation to Antony. When Augustus returned conqueror, the
man went out to meet him with the crow suited to the occasion perched on
his fist, and every now and then it kept exclaiming, Salve, CÃ¦sar,
Victor Imperator! Hail, CÃ¦sar, Conqueror and Emperor! Augustus,
greatly struck and delighted with so novel a circumstance, purchased the
bird of the man for a sum which immediately raised him into
opulence. image
