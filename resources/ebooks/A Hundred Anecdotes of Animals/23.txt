Crab Fishing

The following is an instance of the extraordinary cunning manifested
by the Racoon. It is fond of crabs, and when in quest of them, will
stand by the side of a swamp, and hang its tail over into the water; the
crabs, mistaking it for food, are sure to lay hold of it; and as soon as
the beast feels them pinch, he pulls them out with a sudden jerk. He
then takes them to a little distance from the water's edge; and in
devouring them, is careful to get them crossways in his mouth, lest he
should suffer from their nippers. image
