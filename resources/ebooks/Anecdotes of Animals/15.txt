The fugitive crept in at a low opening, dragging his stores along. When he reached a wider and higher place, he found some obstacle before
him. He drew his dirk, but unwilling to strike, lest he might take the
life of a companion in hiding, he stooped down, and found a goat with
her kid stretched on the ground. He soon saw that the animal was in
great pain, and feeling her body and limbs, found that her leg was
broken. He bound it up with his garter, and offered her a share of the
bread beside him; but she put out her tongue, as if to tell him that her
mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her water, which she drank
readily, and then ate some bread. After midnight he ventured out of the
cave.
