Forced to
seek concealment in a coppice, a white owl settled on the bush under
which he was hidden. At the sight of this bird, the prince's pursuers

custom to this day, at all their great festivals; and some tribes have
an idol in the form of an owl, to which they fasten the real legs of
this bird. XCII
