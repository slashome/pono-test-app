The faithful animal ran to the room where
the journeymen slept, but as they did not seem to hear him barking, he
drew away the bed-clothes, and pulling them alternately by the arms,
forcibly woke them; then barking very loud, he showed the way to the
thief, and went on before; but the men would not follow him, and at last
they locked their door. The dog, having lost all hopes of the assistance
of these men, undertook the task alone, and ran downstairs. He could not
find the villain in the shop, but instantly rushing into the street came
up with him, and tearing off his cloak, would have treated him according
to his deserts if the fellow had not called to some tailors in the
neighborhood, and begged them to help him. They came to his aid, and
drove the poor animal away. XLVI

THE
GOAT

A gentleman who had taken an active part in the rebellion of 1715,
after the battle of Preston escaped into the West Highlands, where a
lady, a near relative, gave him a hiding-place. A faithful servant
conducted him to the mouth of a cave and gave him an abundant store of
food.
