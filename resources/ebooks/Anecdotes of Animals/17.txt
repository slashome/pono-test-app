The lioness arrived unseen by the huntsman, so that he had not time, or
perhaps wanted the courage to take his gun. After having for some time
looked at the man that was thus feasting her young, the lioness went
away, and soon afterward returned, bearing with her a sheep, which she
laid at the huntsman's feet. The Moor, thus become one of the family, took this occasion of making
a good meal, skinned the sheep, made a fire, and then roasted a part,
giving the entrails to the young. The lion in his turn came also; and,
as if respecting the rights of hospitality, he showed no tokens whatever
of ferocity. Their guest the next day, having finished his provisions,
returned, and resolved never more to kill any of those animals, the
noble generosity of which he had so fully proven. He stroked and
caressed the cubs at taking leave of them, and the mother and father
went with him till he was safely out of the forest. XLIX

A SLY
COUPLE

A gentleman in the county of Stirling kept a greyhound and a pointer,
and being fond of coursing, the pointer was accustomed to find the
hares, and the greyhound to catch them. When the season was over, it was
found that the dogs were in the habit of going out by themselves, and
killing hares for their own amusement. To prevent this, a large iron
ring was fastened to the pointer's neck by a leather collar, and allowed
to hang down so as to prevent the dog from running or jumping over
ditches and dykes. The animals, however, continued to stroll out into
the fields together; and one day the gentleman, suspecting that they
were up to some sort of mischief, decided to watch them. To his
surprise, he found that the moment when they thought no one was looking
at them, the greyhound took up the iron ring in his mouth, and carrying
it, they set off to the hills, and began to search for hares as usual. They were followed, and it was discovered that whenever the pointer
scented the hare, the ring was dropped, and the greyhound stood ready to
pounce upon the poor little creature the moment the other drove her from
her form, but that he always came back to help his friend after he had
caught his prey. OSTRICH
RIDING

A gentleman tells how, during the time he was living at Podor, a
French factory on the banks of the river Niger, there were two
ostriches, though young, of gigantic size, which afforded him a very
remarkable sight. They were, he says, so tame that two little blacks
mounted both together on the back of the largest. No sooner did he feel
their weight, than he began to run as fast as possible, and carried them
several times round the village, as it was impossible to stop him
otherwise than by putting something in the path. This sight pleased me
so much, that I was anxious to have it repeated, and to try their
strength, directed a full-grown negro to mount the smaller and the two
boys the larger. This burden did not seem at all too much for their
strength. At first they went at a fairly sharp trot, but when they
became heated a little, they expanded their wings as though to catch the
wind, and moved with such fleetness that they scarcely seemed to touch
the ground. Most people have, at one time or another, seen a partridge
run; and therefore know that there is no man whatever able to keep up
with it; and it is easy to imagine, that if this bird had a longer step,
its speed would be much greater. The ostrich moves much like the
partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied that
those I am speaking of, would have distanced the fleetest racehorses
that were ever bred in England. It is true they would not hold out as
long as a horse; but they would undoubtedly go over a given space in
less time. I have often seen this performance, and it gives one an idea
of the wonderful strength of an ostrich, and shows of what use it might
be, did we but know how to break and manage it as we do a horse.

RETRIBUTION

A fawn that was drinking in a park, was suddenly pounced upon by one
of the swans, that pulled the animal into the water, and held it under
till it was drowned. This cruel deed was noticed by the other deer in
the park, and did not go long unrevenged; for shortly after this the
very swan, which had never till this time been molested by the deer, was
singled out when on land one day, and furiously attacked by the herd,
which closed around the cruel swan, and soon killed it. LII

AN
ELEPHANT'S REVENGE

Persons who have the care of elephants have often noticed that they
know very well when any one is making fun of them, and that they very
often revenge themselves when they have an opportunity. A painter wished
to draw an elephant in the menagerie at Paris, and wanted to get the
animal in a ridiculous attitude, which was with his trunk lifted up and
his mouth open. To make the elephant keep this position, an attendant threw fruit and
nuts into the open mouth, but sometimes he only pretended to throw them. This made the animal very angry, and as if knowing that the painter
rather than his servant was the one to blame, he finally turned to him
and dashed a quantity of water from his trunk over the paper on which
the painter was sketching his portrait. LIII

STRANGE
PLAYMATES

A little girl about three years of age was noticed for a number of
days going a considerable distance from the house with a piece of bread
her mother had given her. This attracted the attention of the mother,
who asked the father to follow the child, and find out what she did with
the bread. On coming to the child, he found her busy at work feeding
several snakes of the species of rattlesnakes called yellow heads. He
quickly took her away, went to the house for his gun, and returning,
killed two of them at one shot, and another a few days afterward. The
child called these snakes as you would call chickens, and when her
father told her if she let them come so near her, they would bite her,
she replied, No, they won't bite. They only eat the bread I give
them.

HONORS TO
THE LIVING AND THE DEAD

The people of Athens, when they had finished the temple, called
Hecatompedon, set at liberty the beasts of burden that had been
chiefly engaged in that work, allowing them to pasture at large, free
from all further service. It is said that one of these animals afterward
came of its own accord to work, and putting itself at the head of the
laboring cattle, marched before them to the citadel. The people were
pleased with this action, and said that the animal should be kept at
public expense as long as it lived. Many people have shown particular
marks of regard in burying animals which they have cherished and been
fond of. The graves of Cimon's mares, with which he thrice conquered at
the Olympic games, are still to be seen near his own tomb. Xanthippus,
whose dog swam by the side of his galley to Salamis, when the Athenians
were forced to abandon their city, afterward buried it with great pomp
upon a promontory, which to this day is called the Dog's Grave. In Pliny, we have an amusing account of a superb funeral ceremony, which
took place during the reign of Claudius; in which the illustrious
departed was no other than a crow, so celebrated for its talents and
address, that it was looked upon as a sort of public property. Its death
was felt as a national loss; the man who
killed it was condemned to expiate the crime with his own life; and
nothing less than a public funeral could, as it was thought, do justice
to its memory.
