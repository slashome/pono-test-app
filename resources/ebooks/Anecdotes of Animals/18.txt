The remains of the bird were laid on a bier, which was
borne by two slaves; musicians went before it, playing mournful airs;
and a great crowd of people of all ages and conditions, brought up the
rear of the melancholy procession. LV

MONKEY
VERSUS SNAKE

The monkeys in India, knowing by instinct how dangerous snakes are,
are most vigilant in their destruction. They seize them by the neck,
when asleep, and running to the nearest flat stone, grind down their
heads by a strong friction on the surface, often looking at them, and
grinning at their progress.
