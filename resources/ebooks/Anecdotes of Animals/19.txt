When sure that the poisonous fangs are
destroyed, they toss the reptiles to their young ones to play with, and
seem to be greatly pleased at the death of their enemies. LVI

FAITHFUL
UNTO DEATH

A dog, between the breed of a mastiff and a bulldog, belonging to a
chimney sweeper, lay, according to his master's orders, on a soot bag,
which he had placed, carelessly, almost in the middle of a narrow back
street, in a town in the south of England. A loaded cart passing by, the
driver told the dog to move out of the way. When he refused to move, he
was scolded, then beaten, first gently, and afterward pretty hard with
the cart whip. But it was all to no purpose; the dog still lay quietly
on the bag. The driver, with an oath, threatened to drive over the
dog–he did so, and the faithful animal, in trying to stop the wheel by
biting it, was crushed to pieces. Faithful unto Death.–Page 112

MUSICAL
SEALS

Seals have a very delicate sense of hearing, and are much delighted
with music. A gentleman, in his account of a voyage to Spitzenbergen,
tells us that the son of the ship's captain who was very fond of playing
on the violin, never failed to have a large audience when in the seas
frequented by these animals; and he has seen them follow the ship for
miles when any person was playing on deck. LVIII

A STRANGE
FOSTER MOTHER

On an estate in Scotland a terrier had a litter of pups, which were
at once taken away from her and drowned. The unfortunate mother was very
unhappy, until, a few weeks later, she saw a brood of ducklings, which
she seized and carried to her house, where she kept them, following them
in and out with the greatest care, and nursing them after her own
fashion, with the most affectionate anxiety. When the ducklings,
following their natural instinct, went into the water, their
foster-mother was terribly alarmed; and as soon as they came back to
land, she quickly snatched them up in her mouth, and ran home with them. What is still more strange is, that the same animal, when her litter of
pups were taken away the year before, seized two chicks, which she
brought up with the same care she now bestowed upon the ducks. When the
young cocks began to try their voices, their foster-mother was as much
annoyed as she now was by the swimming of the duckings–and never failed
to repress their attempts at crowing. LIX

SONNINI
AND HIS CAT

M. Sonnini, when in Egypt, had an Angora cat, of which he was
extremely fond. It was entirely covered with long white silken hairs,
and its tail formed a magnificent plume, which the animal elevated at
pleasure over its body. Not one spot, not a single dark shade marred the
dazzling whiteness of its coat. Its nose and lips were of a delicate
rose color. Two large eyes sparkled in its round head; one was of yellow
and the other of fine blue. This beautiful animal had even more beauty of manners than grace in
attitude and movements. However ill any one used her, she never tried to
put out her claws from their sheaths. Sensible to kindness, she licked
the hand which caressed, and even the one which tormented her. In
Sonnini's solitary moments, she kept the most of the time close by his
side. She interrupted him often in the midst of his labors or
meditations, by little caresses that were very touching, and she usually
followed him in his walks. During his absence she sought and called for
him all the time. She knew his voice at a distance, and seemed on each
fresh meeting with him to feel increased delight. This animal, says Sonnini, was my principal amusement for several
years. How plainly was her love for me shown in her
face! How many times have her caresses made me forget my troubles and
comforted me in the midst of my misfortunes! My beautiful and
interesting companion, however, at last died. After several days of
suffering, during which I never left her, the light of her eyes, which
were constantly fixed on me, went out, and her death rent my heart with
sorrow.

THE DINNER
BELL

It is customary in large boarding-houses to announce the dinner-hour
by sounding a bell. A cat belonging to one of these houses always
hastened to the hall on hearing the bell, to get its usual meal; but it
happened one day that she was shut up at dinner time in a chamber, and
it was in vain for her that the bell had rung. Some hours afterward,
having been released from her confinement, she hastened to the hall, but
found nothing left for her. The clever cat then went to the bell, and
ringing it, tried to call the family to a second dinner, in which she
hoped to get her usual share. LXI

FORAGING

A constable once made a complaint before a bench of London
magistrates against a horse for stealing hay. The complainant stated
that the horse came regularly every night of its own accord, and without
any attendant, to the coach stands in St.
