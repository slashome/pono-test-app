This practise was repeated day after day,
and several times a day. LXXII

RARE
HONESTY

A mastiff dog, who owed more to the kindness of a neighbor than to
his master, was once locked by mistake in the well-stored pantry of his
benefactor for a whole day, where there were, within his reach, milk,
butter, bread and meat, in abundance. On the return of the servant to
the pantry, seeing the dog come out, and knowing the time it had been
shut in there, she trembled for fear of the waste which she was sure her
carelessness must have brought about; but on close examination, it was
found that the honest creature had not tasted of anything, although, on
coming out, he fell on a bone that was given him, with all the
greediness of hunger. LXXIII

DIVISION
OF LABOR

The Alpine marmots are said to work together in the collection of
materials for the building of their homes. Some of them, we are told,
cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve as
wagons to carry it to their holes; while still others perform all the
work of draught horses. The manner of the latter part of the curious
process is this. The animal that is to be the wagon, lies down on its
back, and stretching out its four legs as wide as it can, allows itself
to be loaded with hay; and those that are to be the horses, drag it,
thus loaded, by the tail, taking care not to upset the creature. The
task of thus serving as a wagon being, evidently, the least desirable
part of the business, is taken by every one of the party in turn. LXXIV

A TALKING
PARROT

During the time that Prince Maurice was ruling in Brazil, he heard of
an old parrot that was much celebrated for answering like a human being,
many of the common questions put to it.
