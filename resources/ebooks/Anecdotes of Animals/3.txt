The abbot then contrived as strange a thing as ever was
seen. Out of a great number of hogs of various ages, which he got
together under a tent, or pavilion, covered with velvet, and before
which he had a table of wood painted with a certain number of keys, he
made an organical instrument, and as he played upon the keys with little
spikes which pricked the hogs, he made them cry in such order and
consonance that he highly delighted the king and all his company. II

A
NEWFOUNDLAND DOG

One of the magistrates in Harbor Grace, in Newfoundland, had an old
dog of the regular web-footed species peculiar to that island, who was
in the habit of carrying a lantern before his master at night, as
steadily as the most attentive servant could do, stopping short when his
master made a stop, and going ahead when he was ready to follow. If his master was away from home, and the command was given Go fetch
thy master, he would at once pick up the lantern, hold it fast between
his teeth, and start for the town, which was more than a mile away from
the home of his master. He would stop at the door of every house which
he knew his master was in the habit of visiting, and laying down his
lantern, growl and strike the door making all the noise in his power,
until it was opened. If his master was not in the house, he would go on
farther in the same way, till he found him. If he had gone with him only
once to a house, this was enough to make him take in that house in his
rounds. III

STUDYING

A magpie belonging to a barber in Rome, could imitate very perfectly
almost everything it heard. Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded
before the shop, and for a day or two afterward the magpie was quite
mute, and seemed sad and melancholy. All who knew it supposed that the
sound of the trumpets had so stunned it as to rob it at once of both
voice and hearing. But this was not the case, as very soon appeared. The bird had all
this time been studying how to imitate the sound of the trumpets; and
when at last master of it, the magpie, to the astonishment of all its
friends, suddenly broke its long silence by a perfect imitation of the
flourish of trumpets it had heard; repeating with the greatest exactness
all the repetitions, stops, and changes. The learning of this lesson,
however, so exhausted the magpie's brain that it forgot everything it
had known before. IV

A GRATEFUL
LIONESS

A dreadful famine raged at Buenos Ayres, yet the governor, afraid of
giving the Indians a habit of spilling Spanish blood, forbade the
people, on pain of death, to go into the fields in search of food, and
he placed soldiers at all outlets to the country, with orders to fire
upon those who should try to disobey him. However, a woman, called Maldonata, was artful enough to get past the
watchful guards, and made her escape. After wandering about the country
for a long time, she came upon a cave into which she went. As soon as
she was inside, she saw therein a lioness, the sight of which frightened
her greatly. She was, however, soon quieted by the caresses of the
animal, who in return for a service done for her by the woman, showed
every sign of affection and friendliness. She never returned from
searching after her own daily food without laying a part of it at the
feet of Maldonata, until her cubs were large and strong enough to walk
abroad, then she took them out one day and never came back. Some time after this Maldonata fell into the hands of the Spaniards,
and was brought back to Buenos Ayres on the charge of having left the
city contrary to orders. The governor, a man of cruelty, condemned the
poor woman to a death which none but the most-cruel tyrant could have
thought of. He ordered some soldiers to take
her out into the country, and leave her tied to a tree, either to die of
hunger, or be torn to pieces by the wild beasts. Two days later, he sent
the same soldiers to see what had happened to her. To their great
surprise, they found her alive and unhurt, though surrounded by lions
and tigers, which a lioness at her feet kept at some distance. As soon
as the lioness saw the soldiers, she fell back a little, so they were
able to unbind Maldonata, who told them the story of this lioness, whom
she knew to be the same one she had formerly helped in the cavern. When
the soldiers were taking Maldonata away, the lioness fawned upon her, as
though unwilling to part from her. The soldiers repeated the story to
their commander, who could do no less than pardon the woman who had been
so wonderfully protected, or he would have proven himself less humane
than the lions themselves. A
REMARKABLE NEWSMAN

One of the carriers of a large newspaper being ill, his son took his
place; but, not knowing the subscribers he was to supply, he took for
his guide a dog which had usually gone over the route with his father. The animal trotted on ahead of the boy and stopped at every door where
the paper was to be left, without making a single mistake, or forgetting
anybody. VI

SHARP-WITTED
BRUIN

The captain of a Greenland whaler being anxious to secure a bear,
without wounding the skin, made trial of the trick of laying a noose of
rope in the snow, and placing a piece of meat within it. A bear, roaming
over the ice nearby was soon attracted to the spot by the smell of the
dainty morsel. He saw the bait, crept up cautiously, and seized it in
his mouth; but his foot at the same time, by a jerk of the rope, became
entangled in the noose. He quietly pushed it off with his paw, and
walked slowly away. Having eaten the piece he had carried away with him,
he returned. The noose, with another piece of meat, having been
replaced, he pushed the rope aside, and again walked off with his
capture. A third time the noose was laid, but having seen how clever the
bear was, the sailors buried the rope beneath the snow, and laid the
bait in a deep hole dug in the centre. The bear once more came back, and
the sailors thought they were now sure of success. But bruin, much wiser
than they expected, after snuffing about the place for a few moments,
scraped the snow away with his paws, threw the rope aside once more, and
again escaped unhurt with his prize. VII

MAKING
SURE

During the war between Augustus CÃ¦sar and Mark Antony, when all the
world stood wondering and uncertain as to which one Fortune would favor,
a poor man at Rome, in order to be prepared for making, in either event,
a bold move for his own advancement, hit upon the following clever plan. He set himself to the training of two crows with such great care, that
at length he had taught them to pronounce with great distinctness, the
one a salutation to CÃ¦sar, and the other a salutation to Antony. When Augustus returned the conqueror, the man went out to meet him
with the proper crow perched on his fist, and every now and then it kept
calling out, Salve, CÃ¦sar, Victor
Imperator! Hail, CÃ¦sar, Conqueror and Imperator! Augustus,
greatly amused and delighted with so novel a greeting, bought the gifted
bird of the man for a sum which was so large that it made him rich. VIII

THE BEAR
AND THE CHILD

Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, had a bear called Marco, of whose sagacity
we have this remarkable story. One cold winter day, a boy, almost frozen
with the cold, entered Marco's hut, without thinking of the danger which
he ran in thus exposing himself to the mercy of the animal which was in
there. Marco, however, instead of doing the child any injury, took him
between his paws, and warmed him by pressing him to his breast until the
next morning, when he let him go. The boy came back to the hut in the
evening, and was received with the same affection. For several days he
had no other home, and it added not a little to his joy to see that the
bear always saved part of his food for him. A number of days passed in
this way without the servants knowing anything of what was going on. At
length, when one of them came one day, rather later than usual, to bring
the bear his supper, he was greatly surprised to see the huge animal
roll his eyes in a furious manner, and act as if he wished him to make
as little noise as possible, for fear of awaking the child whom he held
clasped to his breast. The animal, though very hungry, did not seem to
be the least moved by the sight of the food which was placed before him. The story of this strange incident was soon spread at court, and reached
the ears of
Leopold; who, with part of his courtiers, was anxious to learn if the
tale of Marco's generosity were true. Several of them spent the night
near his hut, and saw with astonishment that the bear never stirred as
long as his guest showed a desire to sleep. At dawn the child awoke, was
very much ashamed to find that he was discovered, and, fearing that he
would be punished, begged pardon. The bear, however, caressed him, and
tried to get him to eat what had been brought to him the evening before. He did this at the request of the courtiers, who conducted him to the
prince. Having learned the whole story, Leopold ordered the little boy
to be taken care of, and he would, no doubt, have soon made his fortune,
had he not died a short time afterward. IX

A CLEVER
CROW

A carrion crow, seeing on a lawn, a brood of fourteen chickens under
the care of a mother-hen, picked up one; but when a young lady opened a
window and gave the alarm, the robber dropped his prey. In the course of
the day, however, the thief returned, together with thirteen other
crows. Then each one seized a chick, and thus the whole brood was
carried off at once. THE POWER
OF MUSIC

One Sunday evening, five singers were walking on the banks of a
river. After some time, being tired with walking, they sat down on the
grass, and began to sing. The field on which they sat was bounded on one
side by a wood, out of which, as they were singing, they noticed a hare
pass with great swiftness toward the place where they were sitting, and
at about twenty yards' distance from them, it stopped. It then seemed
greatly delighted with the music, often turning up the side of its head
so as to hear more easily. As soon as the singing was over, the hare
returned slowly toward the wood. When she had nearly reached the end of
the field, the singers began to sing the same piece again. The hare
stopped, turned round, and came swiftly back to about the same distance
as before, where she seemed to listen with great delight, till they had
finished, when she returned again by a slow pace up the field, and
entered the wood. XI

AN AMUSING
MIMIC

A priest once brought up an ourang-outang, which became so fond of
him that, wherever he went, it always wanted to go with him. Whenever,
therefore, he had to perform the service of his church, he was obliged
to shut him up in his room. Once, however, the animal got out, and
followed the father to the church. Silently mounting the sounding board
above the pulpit, he lay perfectly still till the sermon commenced. He
then crept to the edge, and looking at the preacher, imitated all his
gestures in so amusing a manner that the congregation could not help
laughing. The father, surprised and confused by this ill-timed mirth,
severely rebuked his audience for their inattention. The reproof failed
in its effect; the congregation still laughed, and the preacher in the
warmth of his zeal, spoke with still more force and action. The ape
mimicked him so exactly that the congregation could no longer restrain
itself, but burst out into long and continued laughter. A friend of the
preacher at length stepped up to him, and pointed out the cause of this
improper conduct; and such was the roguish air of the animal that it was
with the utmost difficulty that the preacher himself kept from laughing,
while he ordered the servants of the church to take the mischievous ape
away. XII

OLD
HABITS

A famous Scotch lawyer, having cause to visit London, decided to make
the journey on horseback rather than by post; for this was before the
days of railways. He, therefore, purchased a horse, and on his arrival
in London, sold his nag, planning to buy another for the return journey. When he had finished his business, and was ready to set out for home, he
went to Smithfield to buy another horse. About dusk, a handsome horse
was offered to him at so cheap a rate, that he suspected the animal
might not be sound; but as he could not find anything the matter with
the horse, he bought it. Next morning he set out on his journey; his
horse had excellent paces, and the first few miles, while the road was
well frequented, our traveller spent in congratulating himself on his
good fortune. On Finchley Common the traveller met a clergyman driving a
one-horse chaise. There was nobody within sight, and the horse by his
actions plainly showed what had been the business of his former master. Instead of passing the chaise, he laid his breast close up to it, and
stopped it, having no doubt that his rider would take advantage of so
fair a chance of following his trade. The clergyman, under the same
mistake, took out his purse without being asked, and assured the
innocent and surprised horseman that it was not
necessary to draw his pistol. The traveler drew back his horse with
apologies to the gentleman, whom he had unwillingly frightened, and
pursued his journey. The horse next made the same suspicious approach to
a coach, from the windows of which a blunderbuss was leveled, with
threats of death to the rider, who was innocent of all offense in deed
or word. In short, after his life had been once or twice endangered by
the suspicions to which his horse's conduct gave rise, and his liberty
as often threatened by peace officers, who were disposed to seize him as
a notorious highwayman, he found himself obliged to part with the animal
for a mere trifle, and had to purchase at a dearer rate, a horse of less
fine figure and action but of better morals. XIII

NOBLE
PERSEVERENCE

Elephants were, of old, employed in India in the launching of ships. It is told of one, that, being directed to force a very large ship into
the water, the work proved to much for its strength. Its master, in
sarcastic tones bade the keeper take away the lazy beast, and bring
another.
