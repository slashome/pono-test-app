All was still. He plucked an armful of grass and cut some tender
twigs, which the goat accepted with signs of great joy and thankfulness. The prisoner took a great deal of comfort in having a living creature in
his dungeon, and he caressed and fed her tenderly. The man who was
trusted to
bring him supplies fell sick; and when another tried to enter the
cavern, the goat furiously opposed him, presenting her horns in all
directions, till the fugitive, hearing a disturbance, came forward. The
new attendant gave the watchword, and so the prisoner knew he was all
right. He spoke to the goat, and she obeyed him, and allowed the servant
to enter. The gentleman was sure that had a band of soldiers attacked
the cavern, his grateful patient would have died in his defense. XLVII

FOX
CHASING

During a fox hunt, Reynard, being hard pressed, had to take refuge up
the chimney of a hot house. He was followed by one of the hounds, who,
passing through a flue nearly fifty feet in length, came out at the top
of the chimney, but in some way missed Reynard in its dark recesses. By
this time a number of people were collected at the top of the chimney. They let down a terrier, who, holding fast by his brush, soon drove him
out. XLVIII

THE RIGHTS
OF HOSPITALITY

A native Moor who went to hunt the lion, having gone far into the
forest, happened to meet with two lion's cubs that came to caress him. The hunter stopped with the little animals, and waiting for the coming
of the father or mother, took out his breakfast and gave them a part.
