She flew at the corner whence he had taken her child,
seized him by the neck, dragged him about the room, put out one of his
eyes, and so tired him by repeated attacks of spur and bill, that in the
space of twelve minutes, during which time the conflict lasted, she
killed the rat, nimbly turned round in triumph to her frightened
nestling, and lovingly sheltered it beneath her protecting wings. XVI

THE
SHEPHERD'S DOG

James Hogg, the shepherd poet, had a dog named Sirrah, who was for
many years his sole companion. He was, the shepherd says, the best dog
he ever saw, in spite of his surly manners and unattractive appearance. The first time he saw the dog, a drover was leading him by a rope, and,
although hungry and lean, I thought, Hogg tells us, I saw a sort of
sullen intelligence in his face, so I gave the drover a guinea for him. I believe there was never a guinea so well spent. He was scarcely a year
old then, and knew nothing of herding; but as soon as he found out that
it was his duty to do so, I can never forget with what eagerness he
learned. He would try every way till he found out what I wanted him to
do; and when once I made him understand a direction, he never forgot or
mistook it again.

About seven hundred lambs, which were at once under Mr. Hogg's care,
broke up at midnight, and scampered off in three divisions across the
hills, in spite of all that the shepherd and an assistant lad could do
to keep them together. Sirrah, cried the shepherd, in great alarm, my
man, they're awa. The night was so dark that he did not see Sirrah, but
the faithful dog had heard his master's words, and without more ado he
set off in quest of the
flock. The shepherd and his companion spent the whole of the night in
scouring the hills, but of neither lambs nor Sirrah could they obtain
the slightest trace. We had nothing for it, says the shepherd, but to
return to our master and tell him that we had lost his whole flock of
lambs. On our way home, however, we came suddenly upon a body of lambs
at the bottom of a deep ravine, and in front of them was sitting Sirrah,
who was looking around for help. We decided that here was at least one
of the divisions which Sirrah had managed to collect; but what was our
astonishment when we discovered that not one of the whole flock was
missing. How he had got all the divisions together in the dark is beyond
my comprehension. I never felt so grateful to any creature under the sun
as I did to my honest Sirrah that morning.

TRAVELLERS

An innkeeper once sent, as a present to a friend, a dog and cat that
had been companions for more than ten months. The carrier took them,
tied up in a bag. A short time after the dog and cat set out together,
and returned to their old home, a distance of thirteen miles. They
jogged along the road side by side, and on one occasion the dog
gallantly defended his fellow-traveller from the attack of another dog
they met. XVIII

FILIAL
DUTY

A surgeon's mate on board a ship relates that while he was lying
awake one evening, he saw a rat come into his berth, and after looking
carefully about the place, go away with the greatest care and silence. Soon after it returned, leading by the ear another rat, which it left at
a small distance from the hole by which they had entered. A third rat
joined this kind conductor; they then foraged about, and picked up all
the small scraps of biscuit; these they carried to the second rat, which
seemed blind, and staid right on the spot where they had left it,
nibbling such food as its faithful friends, whom the story-teller thinks
were its children, brought to it from the more remote parts of the
room. XIX

A DOG
SHEEP-STEALER

A shepherd, who was hung for sheep-stealing, used to commit the
robberies by means of his dog.
