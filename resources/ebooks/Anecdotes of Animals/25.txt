It was at a great distance; but
so much had been said about it that the prince's curiosity was roused,
and he directed it to be sent for. When the parrot was brought into the room where the prince was
sitting, in company with several Dutchmen, it at once cried out in the
Brazilian language, What a company of white men are here! They asked
it, Who is that man? (pointing to the prince). The parrot answered,
Some general or other. When the attendants carried it up to him, he
asked it, through the aid of an interpreter (for he did not understand
its language), Whence do you come? The parrot answered, From
Marignan.

The prince asked, To whom do you belong? It answered, To a
Portuguese. He asked again, What do you there? The parrot answered,
I look after chickens. The prince laughing, exclaimed, You look after
chickens! The parrot in reply said, Yes, I do; and I know well how to
do it; clucking at the same time in imitation of the noise made by the
hen to call her little chicks together. The prince afterward said that although the parrot spoke in a
language he did not understand, yet he could not be deceived, for he had
in the room at the time both a Dutchman who spoke Brazilian, and a
Brazilian who spoke Dutch; that he asked them separately and privately,
and both agreed exactly in their account of the parrot's
conversation. LXXV

A
CHARITABLE CANARY

A pair of goldfinches who had had the misfortune to be captured with
their nest and six young ones, were placed in a double cage, with a pair
of canaries, which had a brood of little ones also; there being a
partition of wire netting between the cages. At first the goldfinches seemed careless about their young ones. The
father canary, attracted by the cries of the baby goldfinches, forced
himself through a flaw in the wire, and began to feed them. This it did
regularly, until the goldfinches undertook the work themselves, and
rendered the kindness of the canary no longer necessary. LXXVI

CHOOSING
THE LEAST OF TWO EVILS

A french dog was taught by his master to run many different errands,
among others to bring him his meals from a restaurant. The dog carried
the food in a basket, and one evening, when the dog was returning to his
master with his dinner, two other dogs, attracted by the savory smell
coming from the basket, made up their minds to attack him. The dog put
his basket on the ground and set himself courageously against the first
one that advanced against him; but while he was fighting with one, the
other ran to the basket, and began to help himself. At length, seeing
that there was no chance of beating both dogs, and saving his master's
dinner, he threw himself between his two opponents, and without further
ceremony, quickly ate up the rest of the food himself, and then returned
to his master with the empty basket. LXXVII

GOING TO
MARKET

A butcher and cattle dealer had a dog which he usually took with him
when he drove cattle to market at a town some nine miles distant from
his home, to be sold.
