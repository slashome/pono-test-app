For ten years they continued to build their nest in the same place, soon
after which the spire was taken down. LXVII

TAME
HARES

The hare is scarcely a domestic animal; yet we have an account of one
that was so tame as to feed from the hand, lie under a chair in the
sitting-room, and appear in every way as easy and comfortable as a
lapdog. It now and then went out into the garden, but, after hopping
about in the fresh air for a while, it always returned to the house. Its
usual companions were a greyhound and a spaniel, with whom it spent its
evenings, the whole three playing and sleeping together on the same
hearth. What makes the circumstance more remarkable is, that the
greyhound and spaniel were both so fond of hare-hunting, that they used
often to go out coursing together, without anybody with them. They were
like the Sly Couple, of whose devotion to the chase an amusing story
is told. A traveller once brought a young hare to such a degree of frolicsome
familiarity, that it would run and jump about his sofa and bed; leap
upon and pat him with its fore feet; or while he was reading, it would
sometimes knock the book out of his hands, as if to claim, like a
fondled child, his exclusive attention. LXVIII

THE PIG
POINTER

A sow, which was a thin, long-legged animal, when young took such a
fancy to some pointer puppies that a gamekeeper on a neighboring estate
was breaking, that it played, and often came to feed with them. This led
the gamekeeper, who had broken many a dog as obstinate as a pig, to
think he might also manage to break a pig. The little animal would often go out with the puppies to some
distance from home; and he coaxed it farther by a sort of pudding made
of barley meal, which he carried in one of his pockets. The other pocket
he filled with stones, which he threw at the pig whenever she
misbehaved. He found the animal tractable, and soon taught her what he wished by
this mode of reward and punishment. They were frequently seen out
together, when the sow quartered her ground as regularly as any pointer,
stood when she came on game (having an excellent nose), and backed other
dogs as well as ever a pointer did. When she came on the cold scent of
game, she slackened her trot, and gradually dropped her ears and tail;
till she was certain, and then fell down on her knees. So staunch was
she, that she would frequently remain for five minutes and upwards on
her point. As soon as the game rose, she always returned to her master,
grunting very loud, for her reward of pudding, if it was not at once
given to her. LXIX

A WISE
OURANG-OUTANG

A well-known traveller tells a story about the ourang-outang in its
wild state, which shows that it has both a good memory and some
ingenuity. When the fruits on the mountains are gone, these animals often go
down to the seacoast, where they feed upon various kinds of shell-fish,
but in particular on a large sort of oyster, which commonly lies open on
the shore. Fearful, he says, of putting in their paws, lest the
oyster should close and crush them, they insert a stone as a wedge
within the shell. This prevents it from closing, and they then drag out
their prey, and devour it at leisure.

A GRATEFUL
RETURN

A favorite house-dog, left to the care of its master's servants,
while he was himself away, would have been starved by them if it had not
found a friend in the kitchen of a friend of its master's, which in
better days it had occasionally visited. On the return of the master it
had plenty at home, and had no further need of food; but still it did
not forget the place where it had found a friend in need. A few days
after, the dog fell in with a duck, which, as he found in no private
pond, he no doubt decided was no private property. He snatched up the
duck in his teeth, carried it to the kitchen where he had been so
generously fed, laid it at the cook's feet, with many polite movements
of his tail, and then scampered off with much seeming joy at having
given this real proof of his gratitude. LXXI

WRENS
LEARNING TO SING

A wren built her nest in a box, so placed that a family had a chance
to watch the mother bird teaching her young ones the art of singing
peculiar to wrens. She fixed herself on one side of the opening in the
box, directly before the young birds, and began singing over her whole
song very distinctly. One of the little birds then tried to imitate her. After singing through a few notes, its voice broke and it lost the tune. The mother at once began again where the young one had failed, and went
very distinctly through the rest of the song. The young bird made a
second attempt, beginning where it had stopped before, and kept up the
song as long as it was able. If the note was lost again, the mother
began anew where it stopped, and finished it. Then the little one
resumed the song and finished it. This done, the mother sang over the whole series of notes a second
time with great care, and a second of the young ones tried to follow
her. The wren followed the same course with this one as with the first;
and so on with the third and all the rest. It sometimes happened that
the young bird would lose the tune three or four or more times in the
same attempt, and the mother would always begin where they stopped and
sing the rest of the song; and when each little bird had sung the whole
song through, she repeated the whole strain. Sometimes two of the young birds began together. The mother did just the
same as when one sang alone.
