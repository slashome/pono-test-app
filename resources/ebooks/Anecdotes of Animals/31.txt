The reception he met
with was cool and mortifying; the nobleman turned his back upon the
veteran, and left him to find his way to the street through a suite of
apartments magnificently furnished. He passed them lost in thought, till, casting his eyes on a most
beautiful sideboard, where a valuable collection of Venetian glass,
polished and formed in the highest degree of perfection, stood on a
damask cloth as a preparation for a splendid entertainment, he took hold
of a corner of the linen, and turning to a faithful mastiff which always
went with him, said to the animal, Here, my poor old friend, you see
how these haughty tyrants indulge themselves, and yet how we are
treated! The poor dog looked his master in the face, and gave tokens
that he understood him. The master walked on, but the mastiff slackened
his pace, and laying hold of the damask cloth with his teeth, gave one
hearty pull, and thus
brought all the glass on the sideboard in shivers to the ground, thus
robbing the unkind nobleman of his favorite exhibition of splendor. XCIII

ARE BEASTS
MERE MACHINES? A gentleman one day talking with a friend said that beasts were mere
machines, and had no sort of reason to direct them; and that when they
cried or made a noise, it was only one of the wheels of the clock or
machine that made it. The friend, who was of a different opinion replied, I have now in my
kitchen two dogs who take turns regularly every other morning to get
into the wheel.
