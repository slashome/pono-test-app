The cubs not trying to escape, were taken alive. The little creatures,
though at first seeming quite unhappy, at length became in some measure
reconciled to their fate, and being quite tame, were allowed sometimes
to go at large about the deck. While the ship was moored to a floe a few days after they were taken,
one of them having a rope fastened round his neck, was thrown overboard. It at once swam to the ice, got upon it, and tried to escape. Finding
itself, however, held by the rope, it tried to free itself in the
following clever way. Near the edge of the floe was a crack in the ice. It was of
considerable length, but only eighteen inches or two feet wide, and
three or four feet deep. To this spot the bear turned; and when, on
crossing the chasm, the bight of the rope fell into it, he placed
himself across the opening; then suspending himself by his hind feet,
with a leg on each side, he dropped his head and most all of his body
into the chasm; and with a foot applied to each side of the neck, tried
for some minutes to push the rope over his head. Finding that this scheme did not work, he moved to the main ice,
and running with great force from the ship, gave a strong put on the
rope; then going backward a few steps, he repeated the jerk. At length,
after repeated attempts to make his escape in this way, every failure of
which he announced with an angry growl, he gave himself up to his hard
fate, and lay down on the ice in angry and sullen silence. LXXXIV

DECEIVING
THE FOWLER

A young pointer, out with his master hunting, ran on a brood of very
small partridges. The old bird cried, fluttered, and ran trembling along
just before the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable
distance; when she took wing and flew farther off, but not out of the
field. At this the dog went back nearly to the place where the young
ones lay concealed in the grass. The old bird no sooner saw this than
she flew back again, settled first before the dog's nose, and a second
time acted the same part, rolling and tumbling about till she drew off
his attention from the brood, and thus succeeded in saving them. LXXXV

ASKING
ASSISTANCE

A party of a ship's crew was sent ashore on a part of the coast of
India, for the purpose of cutting wood for the ship. One of the men,
having strayed from the rest, was greatly frightened by the appearance
of a large lioness, who came toward him. But when she had come up to
him, she lay down at his feet, and looked very earnestly, first at him,
and then at a tree a short distance off. After doing this several times,
she arose and started toward the tree, looking back at the man several
times, as if trying to make him follow her. At length he went, and when
he reached the tree, he saw a huge baboon with two young cubs in her
arms. He supposed they must belong to the lioness, as she lay down like
a cat, and seemed to be watching them very anxiously. The man being
afraid to climb the tree, decided to cut it down, and having his axe
with him, he at once set to work, the lioness, meantime, watching to see
what he was doing. When the tree fell, she sprang upon the baboon, and
after tearing her in pieces, she turned round and fawned round the man,
rubbing her head against him in great fondness, and in token of her
gratitude for the service he had done her. After this she took the cubs
away, one at a time, and the man went back to the ship. LXXXVI

DOG
SMUGGLERS

In the Netherlands, they use dogs of a very large and strong breed as
they would horses. They are harnessed like horses, and chiefly employed
in drawing little carts filled with fish, vegetables, and other produce. Before the year 1795, such dogs were also employed in smuggling; which
was the easier, as they are exceedingly docile. The dogs were trained to go back and forth between two places on the
frontiers, without any person to attend them. Being well loaded with
little parcels of goods, lace, and the like, they set out at midnight,
and went only when it was perfectly dark. An excellent, quick-scented
dog always went some paces before the others, stretched out his nose
toward all quarters, and when he scented custom house officers, turned
back, which was the signal for immediate flight. Concealed behind bushes, or in ditches, the dogs waited till all was
safe, then continued their journey, and at last reached, beyond the
frontier, the dwelling-house of the receiver of the goods, who was in
the secret. But here, also, the leading dog only at first showed
himself. On a certain whistle, which was a signal that all was right,
they all hastened up. They were then unloaded,
taken to a nearby stable, where there was a good layer of hay and plenty
of good food. There they rested until midnight, and they then returned
in the same manner as they had come, back over the frontiers. LXXXVII

PORUS
SAVED BY HIS ELEPHANT

King Porus, in a battle with Alexander the Great, being severely
wounded, fell from the back of his elephant. The Macedonian soldiers,
supposing him dead, pushed forward, in order to rob him of his rich
clothing and accoutrements; but the faithful elephant, standing over the
body of its master, boldly drove back every one who dared to come near,
and while the enemy stood at bay, took the bleeding Porus up with his
trunk, and placed him again on his back. The troops of Porus came by this time to his relief, and the king was
saved; but the elephant died of the wounds which it had so bravely
received in the heroic defense of its master. LXXXVIII

A HUMANE
SOCIETY

A large colony of rooks had lived for many years in a grove on the
banks of a river. One quiet evening the idle birds amused themselves
with chasing one another through endless mazes, and in their flight they
made the air sound with many discordant noises. In the midst of this
play, it unfortunately happened that one of the rooks, by a sudden turn,
struck his head against the wing of another. The wounded bird instantly
fell into the river. A general cry of distress followed. The birds
hovered with every expression of anxiety over their distressed
companion. Encouraged by their sympathy, and perhaps by the language of counsel
known to themselves, he sprang into the air, and by one strong effort
reached the point of a rock that projected into the river. The joy
became loud and universal; but, alas! it was soon changed into notes of
sorrow, for the poor, wounded bird, in trying to fly toward his nest,
dropped again into the river, and was drowned. LXXXIX

A MOTHER
WATCHING HER YOUNG

The following singular instance of the far-sighted watchfulness of
the mother turkey over her young is told by a French priest. I have
heard, he says, a mother turkey, when at the head of her brood, send
forth the most hideous scream, without being able to see any cause for
it. Her young ones, however, the moment the warning was given, hid under
the bushes, the grass, or whatever else seemed to offer shelter or
protection. They even stretched themselves at full length on the ground,
and lay as motionless as if dead. In the meantime, the mother, with her eyes directed upward, kept up
her cries and screaming as before. On looking up in the direction in
which she seemed to gaze, I discovered a black spot just under the
clouds, but was unable at first to decide what it was. However, it soon
appeared to be a bird of prey, though at first at too great a distance
to be distinguished. I have seen one of those mother turkeys continue in
this agitated state for four hours at a stretch, and her whole brood
pinned down to the ground, as it were, the whole of that time, while
their foe has taken its circuits, has mounted and hovered directly over
their heads. When he, at last, disappeared, the mother changed her note
and sent forth a
different sort of cry, which in an instant gave life to the whole
trembling brood, and they all flocked round her with expressions of
pleasure, as if conscious of their happy escape from danger.

A REFUGEE
SQUIRREL

A squirrel, whose bad luck it was to be captured, was lodged for safe
keeping in a trap used for taking rats alive. Here he remained for
several weeks, till at length, panting for liberty, he managed to make
his escape through a window, and went back once more to his native
fields. The family in which he had been pet, were not a little vexed at the
loss of their little favorite, and the servant was ordered in the
evening of the same day to remove the trap, that they might no longer be
reminded of their loss.
