The dog was very clever at managing the
cattle. At last, so sure was the master of the wisdom and faithfulness of his
dog, that he made a wager that he would trust him with a certain number
of sheep and oxen, and let him drive them to the market all by himself. It was agreed that no person should be within sight or hearing–at least
no one who had any control over the dog; nor was anybody to interfere or
be within a quarter of a mile. On the day of the trial, the dog went about his business in the most
skilful and knowing manner; and although he had often to drive his
charge through the herds that were grazing, yet he never lost one, but
conducting them into the very yard to which he was wont to drive them
when with his master, he delivered them up to the person appointed to
receive them. What more particularly marked the dog's sagacity was, that, when the
path the herd travelled lay through a spot where others were grazing, he
would run forward, stop his own drove, and then
driving the others from each side of the path, collect his scattered
charge and then go on again. He was several times afterward sent thus
alone for the amusement of the curious or the convenience of his master,
and always did his work in the same adroit and intelligent manner. LXXVIII

THE
CATCHER CAUGHT

During a sudden flood in the Rhine, a hare, unable to find a way of
escape through the water to higher land, climbed up a tree. One of the
boatmen rowing about to assist the unfortunate people, seeing her, rowed
up to the tree, and, eager for the game, climbed it, without properly
fastening his boat. The frightened hare, as its pursuer came near, sprang from the tree
into the boat, which thus set in motion, floated away, leaving its owner
in the tree in dread of being washed away by the current. After several
hours' anxiety, he was seen, and taken off by some of his
companions. LXXIX

SNAKE
DESTROYERS

The Indian ichneumon, a small creature, looking like both the weasel
and the mongoose, is of great use to the natives because of its great
hatred of snakes, which would otherwise make every footstep of the
traveller most dangerous. This little creature, on seeing a snake, no
matter how large, will instantly dart on it, and seize it by the throat,
if he finds himself in an open place, where he has a chance of running
to a certain herb, which he some way knows to be an antidote against the
poison of the bite, if he should happen to receive one. A gentleman
visiting the island of Ceylon saw the experiment tried in a closed room,
where the ichneumon, instead of attacking his enemy, did all in his
power to avoid him. On being carried out of the house, however, and put
near his antagonist in the field, he at once darted at the snake, and
soon killed it. It then suddenly disappeared for a few minutes, and
again returned as soon as it had found and eaten the herb it knew was an
antidote. LXXX

MUSICAL
MICE

One rainy winter evening, as I was alone in my room, says an
American gentleman, I took up my flute and began to play. In a few
minutes my attention was directed to a mouse that I saw creeping from a
hole, and coming toward the chair in which I was sitting. I stopped
playing, and it ran quickly back to its hole. I began again shortly
afterward, and was much surprised to see it reappear, and take its old
position. The actions of the little animal were truly amusing. It lay
down on the floor, shut its eyes, and seemed delighted, but the minute I
stopped my playing, it instantly disappeared again. This experiment I
often repeated with the same result. I also noted that the mouse was
differently affected, as the music varied from the slow and sad to the
brisk or lively. It finally went away, and all my art could not coax it
to return.

A
CARRIER'S DOG

A carrier on his way to a market town had to stop at some houses by
the roadside, in the way of his business, leaving his cart and horse
upon the public road, under the protection of a passenger and a trusty
dog. Upon his return he missed one of the women passengers, and likewise
a led horse which was owned by a gentleman of the neighborhood. The
horse he was taking along, tied to the end of the cart. On inquiry he
found out that during his absence, the woman, who had been anxious to
try the mettle of the pony, had mounted it, and the animal had set off
at full speed. The carrier expressed much anxiety for the safety of the
young woman, casting at the same time an expressive look at his dog. Oscar observed his master's eye, and aware of its meaning, instantly set
off in pursuit of the pony. Coming up with it soon after, he made a
sudden spring, seized the bridle, and held the animal fast. Several
people, having seen his actions, and the dangerous situation of the
girl, hastened to her aid. Oscar, however, notwithstanding their
repeated endeavors, would not let go his hold, and the pony was actually
led into the stable with the dog still clinging to it. When the carrier
entered the stable, Oscar wagged his tail in token of his satisfaction,
and at once gave up the bridle to his master. A Carrier's Dog.–Page 160

A TAME
COLONY

A well-known traveller, in describing the Island of Tristan d'Acunha,
states that the animals found on this lonely spot were so tame, that it
was necessary to clear a path right through the mass of birds which were
sitting on the rocks, and this was done by simply kicking them aside. One kind of seal did not move at all when struck or pelted, and at last
some of the company amused themselves by mounting them, and riding them
into the sea. LXXXIII

THE BEAR
CUBS

A mother bear, with two cubs, came too near a whaler, and was shot.
