SABINUS
AND HIS DOG

After the execution of Sabinus, the Roman general, who was put to
death because of his attachment to the family of Germanicus, his body
was left lying unburied upon the precipice of the GemoniÃ¦, as a warning
to all who should dare to befriend the house of Germanicus. No friend
had the courage to go near the body; one only remained true–his faithful
dog.
