21.–Moloch. A Modern Lizard that Surpasses the Stegosaurs in All
but Size. For, unlike man and the higher vertebrates, reptiles and fishes do
not have a maximum standard of size which is soon reached and rarely
exceeded, but continue to grow throughout life, so that the size of a
turtle, a crocodile, or a Dinosaur tells something of the duration of
its life. Before quitting Triceratops let us glance for a moment at its
skeleton. Now among other things a skeleton is the solution of a problem
in mechanics, and in Triceratops the head so dominates the rest of the
structure that one might almost imagine the skull was made first and the
body adjusted to it. The great head seems made not only for offence and
defence; the spreading frill serves for the attachment of muscles to
sustain the weight of the skull, while the work of the muscles is made
easier by the fact that the frill reaches so far back of the junction of
head with neck as to largely
counterbalance the weight of the face and jaws. When we restored the
skull of this animal it was found that the centre of gravity lay back of
the eye. Several of the bones of the neck are united in one mass to
furnish a firm attachment for the muscles that support and move the
skull, but as the movements of the neck are already restricted by the
overhanging frill, this loss of motion is no additional
disadvantage. TRICERATOPS PRORSUS Marsh Fig. 22.–Skeleton of Triceratops. To support all this
weight of skull and body requires very massive legs, and as the fore
legs are very short, this enables Triceratops to browse comfortably from
the ground by merely lowering the front of the head. These forms we have been considering were the giants of the group,
but a commoner species, Thespesius, though less in bulk than those just
mentioned, was still of goodly proportions, for, as he stalked about,
the top of his head was twelve feet from the ground. Thespesius and his kin seem to have been comparatively abundant, for
they have a wide distribution, and many specimens, some almost perfect,
have been discovered in this country and abroad. No less than
twenty-nine Iguanodons, a European relative of Thespesius, were found in
one spot in mining for coal at Bernissart, Belgium. Here, during long
years of Cretaceous time, a river slowly cut its way through the
coal-bearing strata to a depth of 750 feet, a depth almost twice as
great as the deepest part of the gorge of Niagara, and then, this being
accomplished, began the work of filling up the valley it had
excavated. It was then a sluggish stream with marshy borders, a stream subject
to frequent floods, when the water, turbid with mud and laden with sand,
overflowed its banks, leaving them, as the waters subsided, covered
thickly with mud. Here, amidst the luxuriant vegetation of a
semi-tropical climate, lived and died the Iguanodons, and here the pick
of the miner rescued them from their long entombment to form part of the
treasures of the museum at Brussels. Like other reptiles, living and extinct, Thespesius was continually
renewing his teeth, so that as fast as one tooth was worn out it was
replaced by another, a point wherein Thespesius had a decided advantage
over ourselves. On the other hand, as there was a reserve supply of
something like 400 teeth in the lower jaw alone, what an opportunity for
the toothache! And then we have a multitude of lesser Dinosaurs, including the
active, predatory species with sharp claws and double-edged teeth. Megalosaurus, the first of the Dinosaurs to be really known, was one of
these carnivorous
species, and from our West comes a near relative, Ceratosaurus, the
nose-horned lizard, a queer beast with tiny fore legs, powerful,
sharp-clawed hind feet, and well-armed jaws. A most formidable foe he
seems, the more that the hollow bones speak of active movements, and
Professor Cope pictured him, or a near relative, vigorously engaged in
combat with his fellows, or preying upon the huge but helpless
herbivores of the marshes, leaping, biting, and tearing his enemy to
pieces with tooth and claw. Professor Osborn, on the other hand, is inclined to consider him as a
reptilian hyena, feeding upon carrion, although one can but feel that
such an armament is not entirely in the interests of peace. Last, but by no means least, are the Stegosaurs, or plated lizards,
for not only were they beasts of goodly size, but they were among the
most singular of all known animals, singular even for Dinosaurs. They
had diminutive heads, small fore legs, long tails armed on either side
near the tip, with two pairs of large spines, while from these spines to
the neck ran
series of large, but thin, and sharp-edged plates standing on edge, so
that their backs looked like the bottom of a boat provided with a number
of little centreboards. Just how these plates were arranged is not
decided beyond a peradventure, but while originally figured as having
them in a single series down the back it seems much more probable that
they formed parallel rows. Fig. 23.–The Horned Ceratosaurus. A Carnivorous Dinosaur. The largest of these plates were two feet in height and length, and
not more than an inch thick, except at the base, where they were
enlarged and roughened to give a firm hold to the thick skin in which
they were imbedded. Be it remembered, too, that these plates and spines
were doubtless covered with horn, so that they were even longer in life
than as we now see them. The tail spines varied in length, according to
the species, from eight or nine inches to nearly three feet, and some of
them have a diameter of six inches at the base. They were swung by a
tail eight to ten feet long, and as a visitor was heard to remark, one
wouldn't like to be about such an animal in fly time. Such were some of the strange and mighty animals that once roamed
this continent from the valley of the Connecticut, where they literally
left their footprints on the sands of time, to the Rocky Mountains,
where the ancient lakes and rivers became cemeteries for the entombment
of their bones. The labor of the collector has gathered their fossil remains from
many a Western canyon, the skill of the preparator has removed them from
their stony sepulchres and the study of the anatomist has restored them
as they were in life. REFERENCES. Most of our large museums have on exhibition fine specimens of
many Dinosaurs, comprising skulls, limbs, and large portions of their
skeletons. The American Museum of Natural History, New York, has the
largest and finest display. The first actual skeleton of a Dinosaur to
be mounted in this country was the splendid Claosaurus at the Yale
University Museum, where other striking pieces are also to be seen. The
mounting of this Claosaurus, which is 29 feet long and 13 feet high,
took an entire year. The United States National Museum is
particularly rich in examples of the great, horned Triceratops, while
the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, has the best Diplodocus. The Field
Columbian Museum and the Universities of Wyoming and Colorado all have
good collections. Fig. 24.–Stegosaurus. An Armored Dinosaur of the Jurassic. The largest single bone of a Dinosaur is the thigh bone of a
Brontosaurus in the Field Columbian Museum, this measuring 6 feet 8
inches in length. The height of a complete hind leg in the American
Museum of Natural History is 10 feet, while a single claw measures 6 by
9 inches. The skeleton of Triceratops restored in papier-machÃ© for the
Pan-American Exposition measured 25 feet from tip of nose to end of tail
and was 10 feet 6 inches to the top of the backbone over the hips, this
being the highest point. The head in the United States National Museum
used as a model is 5 feet 6 inches long in a straight line and 4 feet 3
inches across the frill. There is a skull in the Yale University Museum
even larger than this. Articles relating to Dinosaurs are mostly technical in their
nature and scattered through various scientific journals. The most
accessible probably is "The Dinosaurs of North America," by Professor O. C. Marsh, published as part of the sixteenth annual report of the United
States Geological Survey. This contains many figures of the skulls,
bones, and entire skeletons of many Dinosaurs. Fig. 25.–Skull of Ceratosaurus. VII

READING THE RIDDLES OF THE ROCKS

"And the first Morning of Creation wrote
What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read."

It is quite possible that the reader may wish to know something of
the manner in which the specimens described in these pages have been
gathered, how we acquire our knowledge of Brontosaurus, Claosaurus, or
any of the many other "sauruses," and how their restorations have been
made. There was a time, not so very long ago, when fossils were looked upon
as mere sports of Nature, and little attention paid to them; later their
true nature was recognized, though they were merely gathered haphazard
as occasion might offer. But now, and for many years past, the
fossil-bearing rocks of many parts of the world have been systematically
worked, and from the material thus obtained we
have acquired a great deal of information regarding the inhabitants of
the ancient world. This is particularly true of our own western country,
where a vast amount of collecting has been done, although very much
remains to be done in the matter of perfecting this knowledge, and hosts
of new animals remain to be discovered. For this information we are
almost as much indebted to the collector who has gathered the needed
material, and the preparator whose patience and skill have made it
available for study, as to the palÃ¦ontologist who has interpreted the
meaning of the bones. To collect successfully demands not only a knowledge of the rocks in
which fossils occur and of the localities where they are best exposed to
view, but an eye quick to detect a piece of bone protruding from a rock
or lying amongst the shale, and, above all, the ability to work a
deposit to advantage after it has been found. The collector of living
animals hies to regions where there is plenty for bird and beast to eat
and drink, but the collector of extinct animals cares little for what is
on the
surface of the earth; his great desire is to see as much as possible of
what may lie beneath. So the prospector in search of fossils betakes
himself to some region where the ceaseless warfare waged by water
against the dry land has seamed the face of the earth with countless
gullies and canyons, or carved it into slopes and bluffs in which the
edges of the bone-bearing strata are exposed to view, and along these he
skirts, ever on the look-out for some projecting bit of bone. The
country is an almost shadeless desert, burning hot by day, uncomfortably
cool at night.
