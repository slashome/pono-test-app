THE EARLIEST KNOWN VERTEBRATES

"We are the ancients of the earth
And in the morning of the times."

There is a universal, and perfectly natural, desire for information,
which in ourselves we term thirst for knowledge and in others call
curiosity, that makes mankind desire to know how everything began and
causes much speculation as to how it all will end. This may take the
form of a wish to know how a millionaire made his first ten cents, or it
may lead to the questions–What is the oldest animal? or, What is the
first known member of the great group of backboned animals at whose head
man has placed himself? and, What did this, our primeval and
many-times-removed ancestor, look like? The question is one that has
ever been full of interest for naturalists, and Nature has been
interrogated in various ways in the hope that she might
be persuaded to yield a satisfactory answer. The most direct way has
been that of tracing back the history of animal life by means of fossil
remains, but beyond a certain point this method cannot go, since, for
reasons stated in various places in these pages, the soft bodies of
primitive animals are not preserved. To supplement this work, the
embryologist has studied the early stages of animals, as their
development throws a side-light on their past history. And, finally,
there is the study of the varied forms of invertebrates, some of which
have proved to be like vertebrates in part of their structure, while
others have been revealed as vertebrates in disguise. So far these
various methods have yielded various answers, or the replies, like those
of the Delphic Oracle, have been variously interpreted so that
vertebrates are considered by some to have descended from the worms,
while others have found their beginnings in some animal allied to the
King Crab. Every student of genealogy knows only too well how difficult a matter
it is to trace a family pedigree back a few centuries, how soon the
family names become changed, the line of descent
obscure, and how soon gaps appear whose filling in requires much patient
research. How much more difficult must it be, then, to trace the
pedigree of a race that extends, not over centuries, but thousands of
centuries; how wide must be some of the gaps, how very different may the
founders of the family be from their descendants! The words old and
ancient that we use so often in speaking of fossils appeal to us
somewhat vaguely, for we speak of the ancient civilizations of Greece
and Rome, and call a family old that can show a pedigree running back
four or five hundred years, when such as these are but affairs of
yesterday compared with even recent fossils. Perhaps we may better appreciate the meaning of these words by
recalling that, since the dawn of vertebrate life, sufficient of the
earth's surface has been worn away and washed into the sea to form, were
the strata piled directly one upon the other, fifteen or twenty miles of
rock. This, of course, is the sum total of sedimentary rocks, for such a
thickness as this is not to be found at any one locality; because,
during the various ups and downs that this world of ours
has met with, those portions that chanced to be out of water would
receive no deposit of mud or sand, and hence bear no corresponding
stratum of rock. The reader may think that there is a great deal of
difference between fifteen and twenty miles, but this liberal margin is
due to the difficulty of measuring the thickness of the rocks, and in
Europe the sum of the measurable strata is much greater than in North
America. The earliest traces of animal life are found deeper still, beneath
something like eighteen to twenty-five miles of rock, while below this
level are the strata in which dwelt the earliest living things,
organisms so small and simple that no trace of their existence has been
left, and we infer that they were there because any given group starts
in a modest way with small and simple individuals. At the bottom, then, of twenty miles of rocks the seeker for the
progenitor of the great family of backboned animals finds the scant
remains of fish-like animals that the cautious naturalist, who is much
given to "hedging," terms, not vertebrates, but prevertebrates or the
forerunners of backboned animals. The earliest of these consist of small
bony plates, and traces of a cartilaginous backbone from the Lower
Silurian of Colorado, believed to represent relatives of ChimÃ¦ra and
species related to those better-known forms Holoptychius and Osteolepis,
which occur in higher strata. There are certainly indications of
vertebrate life, but the remains are so imperfect that little more can
be said regarding them, and this is also true of the small conical teeth
which occur in the Lower Silurian of St. Petersburg, and are thought to
be the teeth of some animal like the lamprey. A little higher up in the rocks, though not in the scale of life, in
the Lower Old Red Sandstone of England, are found more numerous and
better preserved specimens of another little fish-like creature, rarely
if ever exceeding two inches in length, and also related (probably) to
the hag-fishes and lampreys that live to-day. These early vertebrates are not only small, but they were
cartilaginous, so that it was essential for their preservation that they
should be
buried in soft mud as soon as possible after death. Even if this took
place they were later on submitted to the pressure of some miles of
overlying rock until, in some cases, their remains have been pressed out
thinner than a sheet of paper, and so thoroughly incorporated into the
surrounding stone that it is no easy matter to trace their shadowy
outlines. With such drawbacks as these to contend with, it can scarcely
be wondered at that, while some naturalists believe these little
creatures to be related to the lamprey, others consider that they belong
to a perfectly distinct group of animals, and others still think it
possible that they may be the larval or early stages of larger and
better-developed forms. Still higher up we come upon the abundant remains of numerous small
fish-like animals, more or less completely clad in bony armor,
indicating that they lived in troublous times when there was literally a
fight for existence and only such as were well armed or well protected
could hope to survive. A parallel case exists to-day in some of the
rivers of South America, where the little cat-fishes would possibly
be eaten out of existence but for the fact that they are covered–some of
them very completely–with plate-armor that enables them to defy their
enemies, or renders them such poor eating as not to be worth the taking. The arrangement of the plates or scales in the living Loricaria is very
suggestive of the series of bony rings covering the body of the ancient
Cephalaspis, only the latter, so far as we know, had no side-fins; but
the creatures are in no wise
related, and the similarity is in appearance only. Fig. 4.–Cephalaspis and Loricaria, an Ancient and a Modern Armored Fish. Pterichthys, the wing fish, was another small, quaint, armor-clad
creature, whose fossilized remains were taken for those of a crab, and
once described as belonging to a beetle. Certainly the buckler of this
fish, which is the part most often preserved, with its jointed, bony
arms, looks to the untrained eye far more like some strange crustacean
than a fish, and even naturalists have pictured the animal as crawling
over the bare sands by means of those same arms. These fishes and their
allies were once the dominant type of life, and must have abounded in
favored localities, for in places are great deposits of their protective
shields jumbled together in a confused mass, and, save that they have
hardened into stone, lying just as they were washed up on the ancient
beach ages ago. How abundant they were may be gathered from the fact
that it is believed their bodies helped consolidate portions of the
strata of the English Old Red Sandstone. Says Mr. Hutchinson, speaking
of the Caithness Flagstones, "They owe their peculiar tenacity and
durability to the dead fishes that rotted in their midst while yet they
were only soft mud. For just as a plaster cast boiled in oil becomes
thereby denser and more durable, so the oily and other matter coming
from decomposing fish operated on the surrounding sand or mud so as to
make it more compact."

It may not be easy to explain how it came to pass that fishes
dwelling in salt water, as these undoubtedly did, were thus deposited in
great numbers, but we may now and then see how deposits of fresh-water
fishes may have been formed. When rivers flowing through a stretch of
level country are swollen during the spring floods, they overflow their
banks, often carrying along large numbers of fishes. As the water
subsides these may be caught in shallow pools that soon dry up, leaving
the fishes to perish, and every year the Illinois game association
rescues from the "back waters" quantities of bass that would otherwise
be lost. Mr.
