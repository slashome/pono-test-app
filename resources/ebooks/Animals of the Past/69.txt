Seneca, Mich., and they are nine and one-half inches in diameter, and a
little over eight feet long; very few tusks, however, reach eight inches
in diameter. The thigh-bone of an old male mastodon measures from
forty-five to forty-six and one-half inches long, the humerus from
thirty-five to forty inches. The height of the mounted skeleton is of
little value as an indication of size, since it depends so much upon the
manner in which the skeleton is mounted. The grinders of the mastodon
have three cross ridges, save the last, which has four, and a final
elevation, or heel. This does not apply to the teeth of very young
animals. The presence or absence of the last grinder will show whether
or not the animal is of full age and size, while the amount of wear
indicates the comparative age of the specimen. The skeleton of the "Warren Mastodon" is described at length by
Dr. J. C. Warren, in a quarto volume entitled "Mastodon Giganteus."
There is much information in a little book by J. P. MacLean, "Mastodon,
Mammoth, and Man," but the reader must not accept all its statements
unhesitatingly. The first volume, 1887, of
the New Scribner's Magazine contains an article on "American Elephant
Myths," by Professor W. B. Scott, but he is under an erroneous
impression regarding the size of the mastodon, and photographs of the
Maya carvings show that their resemblance to elephants has been
exaggerated in the wood cuts. The story of the Lenape Stone is told at
length by H. C. Mercer in "The Lenape Stone, or the Indian and the
Mammoth."

WHY DO ANIMALS BECOME EXTINCT? "And Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp
Abode his destined Hour and went his way."

It is often asked "why do animals become extinct?" but the question
is one to which it is impossible to give a comprehensive and
satisfactory reply; this chapter does not pretend to do so, merely to
present a few aspects of this complicated, many-sided problem. In very many cases it may be said that actual extermination has not
taken place, but that in the course of evolution one species has passed
into another; species may have been lost, but the race, or phylum
endures, just as in the growth of a tree, the twigs and branches of the
sapling disappear, while the tree, as a whole, grows onward and upward. This is what we see in the horse, which is the living representative of
an unbroken line reaching back
to the little Eocene Hyracothere. So in a general way it may be said
that much of what at the first glance we might term extinction is really
the replacement of one set of animals by another better adapted to
surrounding conditions. Again, there are many cases of animals, and particularly of large
animals, so peculiar in their make up, so very obviously adapted to
their own special surroundings that it requires little imagination to
see that it would have been a difficult matter for them to have
responded to even a slight change in the world about them. Such great
and necessarily sluggish brutes as Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, with
their tons of flesh, small heads, and feeble teeth, were obviously
reared in easy circumstances, and unfitted to succeed in any strenuous
struggle for existence. Stegosaurus, with his bizarre array of plates
and spines, and huge-headed Triceratops, had evidently carried
specialization to an extreme, while in turn the carnivorous forms must
have required an abundant supply of slow and easily captured prey. Coming down to a more recent epoch, when the
big Titanotheres flourished, it is easy to see from a glance at their
large, simple teeth that these beasts needed an ample provision of
coarse vegetation, and as they seem never to have spread far beyond
their birthplace, climatic change, modifying even a comparatively
limited area, would suffice to sweep them out of existence. To use the
epitaph proposed by Professor Marsh for the tombstone of one of the
Dinosaurs, many a beast might say, "I, and my race perished of over
specialization." To revert to the horse it will be remembered that this
very fate is believed to have overtaken those almost horses the European
Hippotheres; they reached a point where no further progress was
possible, and fell by the wayside. There is, however, still another class of cases where species,
families, orders, even, seem to have passed out of existence without
sufficient cause. Those great marine reptiles, the Ichthyosaurs, of
Europe, the Plesiosaurs and Mosasaurs, of our own continent, seem to
have been just as well adapted to an aquatic life as the whales, and
even better than the seals, and we can see no reason why Columbus
should not
have found these creatures still disporting themselves in the Gulf of
Mexico. The best we can do is to fall back on an unknown "law of
progress," and say that the trend of life is toward the replacement of
large, lower animals by those smaller and intellectually higher. But why there should be an allotted course to any group of
animals, why some species come to an end when they are seemingly as well
fitted to endure as others now living, we do not know, and if we say
that a time comes when the germ-plasm is incapable of further
subdivision, we merely express our ignorance in an unnecessary number of
words. The mammoth and mastodon have already been cited as instances of
animals that have unaccountably become extinct, and these examples are
chosen from among many on account of their striking nature. The great
ground sloths, the Mylodons, Megatheres, and their allies, are another
case in point. At one period or another they reached from Oregon to
Virginia, Florida, and Patagonia, though it is not claimed that they
covered all this area at one time. And, while it may be freely
admitted that
in some portions of their range they may have been extirpated by a
change in food-supply, due in turn to a change in climate, it seems
preposterous to claim that there was not at all times, somewhere in this
vast expanse of territory, a climate mild enough and a food-supply large
enough for the support of even these huge, sluggish creatures. We may
evoke the aid of primitive man to account for the disappearance of this
race of giants, and we know that the two were coeval in Patagonia, where
the sloths seem to have played the rÃ´le of domesticated animals, but
again it seems incredible that early man, with his flint-tipped spears
and arrows, should have been able to slay even such slow beasts as these
to the very last individual. Of course, in modern times man has directly exterminated many
animals, while by the introduction of dogs, cats, pigs, and goats he has
indirectly not only thinned the ranks of animals, but destroyed plant
life on an enormous scale. But in the past man's capabilities for harm
were infinitely less than now, while of course the greatest changes took
place before man
even existed, so that, while he is responsible for the great changes
that have taken place in the world's flora and fauna during recent
times, his influence, as a whole, has been insignificant. Thus, while
man exterminated the great northern sea-cow, Rytina, and Pallas's
cormorant on the Commander Islands, these animals were already
restricted to this circumscribed area[22] by natural causes, so that man but
finished what nature had begun. The extermination of the great auk in
European waters was somewhat similar. There is, however, this
unfortunate difference between extermination wrought by man and that
brought about by natural causes: the extermination of species by nature
is ordinarily slow, and the place of one is taken by another, while the
destruction wrought by man is rapid, and the gaps he creates remain
unfilled. [22] It is
possible that the cormorant may always have been confined to this one
spot, but this is probably not the case with the sea-cow. Not so very long ago it was customary to account for changes in the
past life of the globe by earthquakes, volcanic outbursts, or cataclysms
of such appalling magnitude that the whole face of nature was changed,
and entire races of living beings swept out of existence at once. But it
is now generally conceded that while catastrophes have occurred, yet,
vast as they may have been, their effects were comparatively local, and,
while the life of a limited region may have been ruthlessly blotted out,
life as a whole was but little affected. The eruption of Krakatoa shook
the earth to its centre and was felt for hundreds of miles around, yet,
while it caused the death of thousands of living beings, it remains to
be shown that it produced any effect on the life of the region taken in
its entirety. Changes in the life of the globe have been in the main slow and
gradual, and in response to correspondingly slow changes in the level of
portions of the earth's crust, with their far-reaching effects on
temperature, climate, and vegetation. Animals that were what is termed
plastic kept pace with the altering conditions about them and became
modified, too, while those that could not adapt themselves to their
surroundings died out. How slowly changes may take place is shown by the occurrence of a
depression in the Isthmus of Panama, in comparatively recent geologic
time, permitting free communication between the Atlantic and Pacific, a
sort of natural inter-oceanic canal. And yet the alterations wrought by
this were, so to speak, superficial, affecting only some species of
shore fishes and invertebrates, having no influence on the animals of
the deeper waters. Again, on the Pacific coast are now found a number of
shells that, as we learn from fossils, were in Pliocene time common on
both coasts of the United States, and Mr. Dall interprets this to mean
that when this continent was rising, the steeper shore on the Pacific
side permitted the shell-fish to move downward and adapt themselves to
the ever changing shore, while on the Atlantic side the drying of a wide
strip of level sea-bottom in a relatively short time exterminated a
large proportion of the less active mollusks. And in this instance
"relatively short" means positively long; for, compared to the rise of a
continent from the ocean's bed, the flow of a glacier is the rapid rush
of a mountain torrent. Then, too, while a tendency to vary seems to be inherent in animals,
some appear to be vastly more susceptible than others to outside
influences, to respond much more readily to any change in the world
about them. In fact, Professor Cook has recently suggested that the
inborn tendency to variation is sufficient in itself to account for
evolution, this tendency being either repressed or stimulated as
external conditions are stable or variable. The more uniform the surrounding conditions, and the simpler the
animal, the smaller is the liability to change, and some animals that
dwell in the depths of the ocean, where light and temperature vary
little, if any, remain at a standstill for long periods of time. The genus Lingula, a small shell, traces its ancestry back nearly to
the base of the Ordovician system of rocks, an almost inconceivable
lapse of time, while one species of brachiopod shell endures unchanged
from the Trenton Limestone to the Lower Carboniferous. In the first case
one species has been replaced by another, so that the shell of to-day is
not exactly like its very remote ancestor, but that the
type of shell should have remained unchanged when so many other animals
have arisen, flourished for a time, and perished, means that there was
slight tendency to variation, and that the surrounding conditions were
uniform. Says Professor Brooks, speaking of Lingula: "The everlasting
hills are the type of venerable antiquity; but Lingula has seen the
continents grow up, and has maintained its integrity unmoved by the
convulsions which have given the crust of the earth its present
form."

Many instances of sudden but local extermination might be adduced,
but among them that of the tile-fish is perhaps the most striking. This
fish, belonging to a tropical family having its headquarters in the Gulf
of Mexico, was discovered in 1879 in moderately deep water to the
southward of Massachusetts and on the edge of the Gulf Stream, where it
was taken in considerable numbers. In the spring of 1882 vessels
arriving at New York reported having passed through great numbers of
dead and dying fishes, the water being thickly dotted with them for
miles. From samples brought in,
it was found that the majority of these were tile-fish, while from the
reports of various vessels it was shown that the area covered by dead
fish amounted to somewhere between 5,000 and 7,500 square miles, and the
total number of dead was estimated at not far from a billion. This enormous and widespread destruction is believed to have been caused
by an unwonted duration of northerly and easterly winds, which drove the
cold arctic current inshore and southwards, chilling the warm belt in
which the tile-fish resided and killing all in that locality. It was
thought possible that the entire race might have been destroyed, but,
while none were taken for many years, in 1899 and in 1900 a number were
caught, showing that the species was beginning to reoccupy the waters
from which it had been driven years before. The effect of any great fall in temperature on animals specially
adapted to a warm climate is also illustrated by the destruction of the
Manatees in the Sebastian River, Florida, by the winter of 1894-95,
which came very near exterminating this species. Readers may remember
that this was the winter that wrought such
havoc with the blue-birds, while in the vicinity of Washington, D. C.,
the fish-crows died by hundreds, if not by thousands. Fishes may also be exterminated over large areas by outbursts of
poisonous gases from submarine volcanoes, or more rarely by some vast
lava flood pouring into the sea and actually cooking all living beings
in the vicinity. And in the past these outbreaks took place on a much
larger scale than now, and naturally wrought more widespread
destruction. A recent instance of local extermination is the total destruction of
a humming-bird, Bellona ornata, peculiar to the island of St. Vincent, by the West Indian hurricane of 1898, but this is naturally
extirpation on a very small scale. Still, the problems of nature are so involved that while local
destruction is ordinarily of little importance, or temporary in its
effects, it may lead to the annihilation of a species by breaking a race
of animals into isolated groups, thereby leading to inbreeding and slow
decline. The European bison, now confined to a part of Lithuania and a
portion of the Caucasus, seems to
be slowly but surely approaching extinction in spite of all efforts to
preserve the race, and no reason can be assigned for this save that the
small size of the herds has led to inbreeding and general decadence. In other ways, too, local calamity may be sweeping in its effects,
and that is by the destruction of animals that resort to one spot during
the breeding season, like the fur-seals and some sea-birds, or pass the
winter months in great flocks or herds, as do the ducks and elk. The
supposed decimation of the Moas by severe winters has been already
discussed, and the extermination of the great auk in European waters was
indirectly due to natural causes. These birds bred on the small, almost
inaccessible island of Eldey, off the coast of Iceland, and when,
through volcanic disturbances, this islet sank into the sea, the few
birds were forced to other quarters, and as these were, unfortunately,
easily reached, the birds were slain to the last one. From the great local abundance of their remains, it has been thought
that the curious short-legged Pliocene rhinoceros, Aphelops fossiger,
was killed off in the West by blizzards when the animals were gathered
in their winter quarters, and other long-extinct animals, too, have been
found under such conditions as to suggest a similar fate. Among local catastrophes brought about by unusually prolonged cold
may be cited the decimation of the fur-seal herds of the Pribilof
Islands in 1834 and 1859, when the breeding seals were prevented from
landing by the presence of ice-floes, and perished by thousands. Peculiar interest is attached to this case, because the restriction of
the northern fur-seals to a few isolated, long undiscovered islands, is
believed to have been brought about by their complete extermination in
other localities by prehistoric man. Had these two seasons killed all
the seals, it would have been a reversal of the customary extermination
by man of a species reduced in numbers by nature. In the case of large animals another element probably played a part. The larger the animal, the fewer young, as a rule, does it bring forth
at a birth, the longer are the intervals between births, and the slower
the growth of the
young. The loss of two or three broods of sparrows or two or three
litters of rabbits makes comparatively little difference, as the loss is
soon supplied, but the death of the young of the larger and higher
mammals is a more serious matter. A factor that has probably played an
important rÃ´le in the extinction of animals is the relation that exists
between various animals, and the relations that also exist between
animals and plants, so that the existence of one is dependent on that of
another. Thus no group of living beings, plants or animals, can be
affected without in some way affecting others, so that the injury or
destruction of some plant may result in serious harm to some animal. Nearly everyone is familiar with the classic example given by Darwin of
the effect of cats on the growth of red clover. This plant is fertilized
by bumble bees only, and if the field mice, which destroy the nests of
the bees, were not kept in check by cats, or other small carnivores,
their increase would lessen the numbers of the bees and this in turn
would cause a dearth of clover. The yuccas present a still more wonderful
example of the dependence of plants on animals, for their existence
hangs on that of a small moth whose peculiar structure and habits bring
about the fertilization of the flower. The two probably developed side
by side until their present state of inter-dependence was reached, when
the extinction of the one would probably bring about that of the
other.
