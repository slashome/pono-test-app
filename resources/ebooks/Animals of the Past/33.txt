II. Like the "Fossil man" the sea-serpent flourishes perennially in the
newspapers and, despite the fact that he is now mainly regarded as a
joke, there have been many attempts to habilitate this mythical monster
and place him on a foundation of firm fact. The most earnest of these
was that of M. Oudemans, who expressed his belief in the existence of
some rare and huge seal-like creature whose occasional appearance in
southern waters gave rise to the
best authenticated reports of the sea-serpent. Among other possibilities
it has been suggested that some animal believed to be extinct had really
lived over to the present day. Now there are a few waifs, spared from
the wrecks of ancient faunas, stranded on the shores of the present,
such as the Australian Ceratodus and the Gar Pikes of North America, and
these and all other creatures that could be mustered in were used as
proofs to sustain this theory. If, it was said, these animals have been
spared, why not others? If a fish of such ancient lineage as the Gar
Pike is so common as to be a nuisance, why may there not be a few
Plesiosaurs or a Mosasaur somewhere in the depths of the ocean? The
argument was a good one, the more that we may "suppose" almost anything,
but it must be said that no trace of any of these creatures has so far
been found outside of the strata in which they have long been known to
occur, and all the probabilities are opposed to this theory. Still, if
some of these creatures had been spared, they might well have
passed for sea-serpents, even though Zeuglodon, the one most like a
serpent in form, was the one most remotely related to snakes. Zeuglodon, the yoke-tooth, so named from the shape of its great
cutting teeth, was indeed a strange animal, and if we wonder at the
Greenland Whale, whose head is one-third its total length, we may
equally wonder at Zeuglodon, with four feet of head, ten feet of body,
and forty feet of tail. No one, seeing the bones of the trunk and tail
for the first time, would suspect that they belonged to the same animal,
for while the vertebrÃ¦ of the body are of moderate size, those of the
tail are, for the bulk of creature, the longest known, measuring from
fifteen to eighteen inches in length, and weighing in a fossil condition
fifty to sixty pounds. In life, the animal was from fifty to seventy
feet in length, and not more than six or eight feet through the deepest
part of the body, while the tail was much less; the head was small and
pointed, the jaws well armed with grasping and cutting teeth, and just
back of the head was a pair of short paddles, not unlike those of a fur
seal. It is curious to speculate on the
habits of a creature in which the tail so obviously wagged the dog and
whose articulations all point to great freedom of movement up and down. This may mean that it was an active diver, descending to great depths to
prey upon squid, as the Sperm-Whale does to-day, while it seems quite
certain that it must have reared at least a third of its great length
out of water to take a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And if
size is any indication of power, the great tail, which obviously ended
in flukes like those of a whale, must have been capable of propelling
the beast at a speed of twenty or thirty miles an hour. Something of the
kind must have been needed in order that the small head might provide
food enough for the great tail, and it has been suggested that inability
to do this was the reason why Zeuglodon became extinct. On the other
hand, it has been ingeniously argued that the huge tail served to store
up fat when food was plenty, which was drawn upon when food became
scarce. The fur seals do something similar to this, for the males come
on shore in May rolling in blubber, and depart in September lean
and hungry after a three months' fast. Zeuglodons must have been very numerous in the old Gulf of Mexico,
for bones are found abundantly through portions of our Southern States;
it was also an inhabitant of the old seas of southern Europe, but, as we
shall see, it gave place to the great fossil shark, and this in turn
passed out of existence. Still, common though its bones may be, stories
of their use for making stone walls–and these stories are still in
circulation–resolve themselves on close scrutiny into the occasional use
of a big vertebra to support the corner of a corn-crib. The scientific name of Zeuglodon is Basilosaurus cetoides,
the whale-like king lizard–the first of these names,
Basilosaurus, having been given to it by the original
describer, Dr. Harlan, who supposed the animal to have been a reptile. Now it is a primary rule of nomenclature that the first name given to an
animal must stick and may not be changed, even by the act of a
zoÃ¶logical congress, so Zeuglodon must, so far as its name is concerned,
masquerade as a reptile for the rest of its paleontological life. This, however, really matters very little, because scientific names are
simply verbal handles by which we may grasp animals to describe them,
and Dr. Le Conte, to show how little there may be in a name, called a
beetle Gyascutus. Owen's name of Zeuglodon, although not tenable as a
scientific name, is too good to be wasted, and being readily remembered
and easily pronounced may be used as a popular name. Fig. 11.–Koch's Hydrarchus, Composed of Portions of the Skeleton of
Several Zeuglodons. One might think that a creature sixty or seventy feet long was amply
long enough, but Dr. Albert Koch thought otherwise, and did with
Zeuglodon as, later on, he did with the Mastodon, combining the vertebrÃ¦
of several individuals until he had a monster 114 feet long! This he
exhibited in Europe under the name of Hydrarchus, or water king, finally
disposing of the composite creature to the Museum of Dresden, where it
was promptly reduced to its proper dimensions. The natural make-up of
Zeuglodon is sufficiently composite without any aid from man, for the
head and paddles are not unlike those of a seal, the ribs are like those
of a manatee, and the shoulder 
blades are precisely like those of a whale, while the vertebrÃ¦ are
different from those of any other animal, even its own cousin and lesser
contemporary Dorudon. There were also tiny hind legs tucked away beneath
skin, but these, as well as many other parts of the animal's structure
were unknown, until Mr.
