THE DINOSAURS

"Shapes of all sorts and sizes, great and small."

A few million years ago, geologists and physicists do not agree upon
the exact number, although both agree upon the millions, when the Rocky
Mountains were not yet born and the now bare and arid western plains a
land of lakes, rivers, and luxuriant vegetation, the region was
inhabited by a race of strange and mighty reptiles upon whom science has
bestowed the appropriate name of Dinosaurs, or terrible lizards. Our acquaintance with the Dinosaurs is comparatively recent, dating
from the early part of the nineteenth century, and in America, at least,
the date may be set at 1818, when the first Dinosaur remains were found
in the Valley of the Connecticut, although they naturally were not
recognized as such, nor had the term
been devised. The first Dinosaur to be formally recognized as
representing quite a new order of reptiles was the carnivorous
Megalosaur, found near Oxford, England, in 1824. Fig. 18.–Thespesius. A Common Herbivorous Dinosaur of the
Cretaceous. For a long time our knowledge of Dinosaurs was very imperfect and
literally fragmentary, depending mostly upon scattered teeth, isolated
vertebrÃ¦, or fragments of bone picked up on the surface or casually
encountered in some mine or quarry. Now, however, thanks mainly to the
labors of American palÃ¦ontologists, thanks also to the rich deposits of
fossils in our Western States, we have an extensive knowledge of the
Dinosaurs, of their size, structure, habits, and general appearance. There are to-day no animals living that are closely related to them;
none have lived for a long period of time, for the Dinosaurs came to an
end in the Cretaceous, and it can only be said that the crocodiles, on
the one hand, and the ostriches, on the other, are the nearest existing
relatives of these great reptiles. For, though so different in outward appearance, birds and reptiles
are structurally quite
closely allied, and the creeping snake and the bird on which it preys
are relatives, although any intimate relationship between them is of the
serpent's making, and is strongly objected to by the bird. But if we compare the skeleton of a Dinosaur with that of an
ostrich–a young one is preferable–and with those of the earlier birds,
we shall find that many of the barriers now existing between reptiles
and birds are broken down, and that they have many points in common. In
fact, save in the matter of clothes, wherein birds differ from all other
animals, the two great groups are not so very far apart. The Dinosaurs were by no means confined to North America, although
the western United States seem to have been their headquarters, but
ranged pretty much over the world, for their remains have been found in
every continent, even in far-off New Zealand. In point of time they ranged from the Trias to the Upper Cretaceous,
their golden age, marking the culminating point of reptilian life, being
in the Jurassic, when huge forms stalked by the sea-shore, browsed amid
the swamps, or
disported themselves along the reedy margins of lakes and rivers. They had their day, a day of many thousand years, and then passed
away, giving place to the superior race of mammals which was just
springing into being when the huge Dinosaurs were in the heyday of their
existence. And it does seem as if in the dim and distant past, as in the
present, brains were a potent factor in the struggle for supremacy; for,
though these reptiles were giants in size, dominating the earth through
mere brute force, they were dwarfs in intellect. The smallest human brain that is thought to be compatible with life
itself weighs a little over ten ounces, the smallest that can exist with
reasoning powers is two pounds; this in a creature weighing from 120 to
150 pounds. What do we find among Dinosaurs? Thespesius, or Claosaurus, which may
have walked where Baltimore now stands, was twenty-five feet in length
and stood a dozen feet high in his bare feet, had a brain smaller than a
man's clenched fist, weighing less than one pound. Brontosaurus, in some respects the biggest brute that ever walked,
was but little better off, and Triceratops, and his relatives, creatures
having twice the bulk of an elephant, weighing probably over ten tons,
possessed a brain weighing not over two pounds! How much of what we term intelligence could such a creature
possess–what was the extent of its reasoning powers? Judging from our
own standpoint and the small amount of intellect apparent in some humans
with much larger brains, these big reptiles must have known just about
enough to have eaten when they were hungry, anything more was
superfluous. However, intelligence is one thing, life another, and the spinal
cord, with its supply of nerve-substance, doubtless looked after the
mere mechanical functions of life; and while even the spinal cord is in
many cases quite small, in some places, particularly in the sacral
region, it is subject to considerable enlargement. This is notably true
of Stegosaurus, where the sacral enlargement is twenty times the bulk of
the puny brain–a fact noted by
Professor Marsh, and seized upon by the newspapers, which announced that
he had discovered a Dinosaur with a brain in its pelvis. In their great variety of size and shape the Dinosaurs form an
interesting parallel with the Marsupials of Australia. For just as these
are, as it were, an epitome of the class of mammals, mimicking the
herbivores, carnivores, rodents and even monkeys, so there are
carnivorous and herbivorous Dinosaurs–Dinosaurs that dwelt on land and
others that habitually resided in the water, those that walked upright
and those that crawled about on all fours; and, while there are no hints
that any possessed the power of flight, some members of the group are
very bird-like in form and structure, so much so that it has been
thought that the two may have had a common ancestry. The smallest of the Dinosaurs whose acquaintance we have made were
little larger than chickens; the largest claim the distinction of being
the largest known quadrupeds that have walked the face of the earth, the
giants not only of their day, but of all time,
before whose huge frames the bones of the Mammoth, that familiar byword
for all things great, seem slight. Fig. 19–A Hind Leg of the Great Brontosaurus, the Largest of the
Dinosaurs. For Brontosaurus, the Thunder Lizard, beneath whose mighty tread the
earth shook, and his kindred were from 40 to 60 feet long and 10 to 14
feet high, their thigh bones measuring 5 to 6 feet in length, being the
largest single bones known to us, while some of the vertebrÃ¦ were 4-1/2
feet high, exceeding in dimensions those of a whale. The group to which Brontosaurus belongs, including Diplodocus and
Morosaurus, is distinguished by a
large, though rather short, body, very long neck and tail, and, for the
size of the animal, a very small head. In fact, the head was so small
and, in the case of Diplodocus, so poorly provided with teeth that it
must have been quite a task, or a long-continued pleasure, according to
the state of its digestive apparatus, for the animal to have eaten its
daily meal. Fig. 20.–A Single Vertebra of Brontosaurus. An elephant weighing 5 tons eats 100 pounds of hay and 25 pounds of
grain for his day's ration; but, as this food is in a comparatively
concentrated form, it would require at least twice this weight of green
fodder. It is a difficult matter to estimate the weight of a live Diplodocus
or a Brontosaurus, but it is
pretty safe to say that it would not be far from 20 tons, and that one
would devour at the very least something over 700 pounds of leaves or
twigs or plants each day–more, if the animal felt really hungry. But here we must, even if reluctantly, curb our imagination a little
and consider another point: the cold-blooded, sluggish reptiles, as we
know them to-day, do not waste their energies in rapid movements, or in
keeping the temperature of their bodies above that of the air, and so by
no means require the amount of food needed by more active, warm-blooded
animals. Alligators, turtles, and snakes will go for weeks, even months,
without food, and while this applies more particularly to those that
dwell in temperate climes and during their winter hibernation
practically suspend the functions of digestion and respiration, it is
more or less true of all reptiles. And as there is little reason for
supposing that reptiles behaved in the past any differently from what
they do in the present, these great Dinosaurs may, after all, not have
been gifted with such ravenous appetites as one might fancy. Still, it is
dangerous to lay down any hard and fast laws concerning animals, and he
who writes about them is continually obliged to qualify his remarks–in
sporting parlance, to hedge a little, and in the present instance there
is some reason, based on the arrangement of vertebrÃ¦ and ribs, to
suppose that the lungs of Dinosaurs were somewhat like those of birds,
and that, as a corollary, their blood may have been better aÃ«rated and
warmer than that of living reptiles. But, to return to the question of
food. From the peculiar character of the articulations of the limb-bones,
it is inferred that these animals were largely aquatic in their habits,
and fed on some abundant species of water plants. One can readily see
the advantage of the long neck in browsing off the vegetation on the
bottom of shallow lakes, while the animal was submerged, or in rearing
the head aloft to scan the surrounding shores for the approach of an
enemy. Or, with the tail as a counterpoise, the entire body could be
reared out of water and the head be raised some thirty feet in the
air. Triceratops, he of the three-horned face, had a remarkable skull
which projected backward over the neck, like a fireman's helmet, or a
sunbonnet worn hind side before, while over each eye was a massive horn
directed forward, a third, but much smaller horn being sometimes present
on the nose. The little "Horned Toad," which isn't a toad at all, is the nearest
suggestion we have to-day of Triceratops; but, could he realize the
ambition of the frog in the fable and swell himself to the dimensions of
an ox, he would even then be but a pigmy compared with his ancient and
distant relative. So far as mere appearance goes he would compare very well, for while
so much is said about the strange appearance of the Dinosaurs, it is to
be borne in mind that their peculiarities are enhanced by their size,
and that there are many lizards of to-day that lack only stature to be
even more bizarre; and, for example, were the Australian Moloch
but big enough, he could give even Stegosaurus "points" in more ways
than one. Standing before the skull of Triceratops, looking
him squarely in the face, one notices in front of each eye a thick guard
of projecting bone, and while this must have interfered with vision
directly ahead it must have also furnished protection for the eye. So
long as Triceratops faced an adversary he must have been practically
invulnerable, but as he was the largest animal of his time, upward of
twenty-five feet in length, it is probable that his combats were mainly
with those of his own kind and the subject of dispute some fair female
upon whom two rival suitors had cast covetous eyes. What a sight it
would have been to have seen two of these big brutes in mortal combat as
they charged upon each other with all the impetus to be derived from ten
tons of infuriate flesh! We may picture to ourselves horn clashing upon
horn, or glancing from each bony shield until some skilful stroke or
unlucky slip placed one combatant at the mercy of the other, and he went
down before the blows of his adversary "as falls on Mount Alvernus a
thunder-smitten oak."

A pair of Triceratops horns in the National Museum bears witness to
such encounters, for one
is broken midway between tip and base; and that it was broken during
life is evident from the fact that the stump is healed and rounded over,
while the size of the horns shows that their owner reached a ripe old
age. Fig.
