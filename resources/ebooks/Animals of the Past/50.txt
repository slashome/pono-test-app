And all this help is needed, for it is an easy matter to make a
wide-sweeping deduction, apparently resting on a good basis of fact, and
yet erroneous. Remains of the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros, found in
Siberia and Northern Europe, were thought to indicate that at the period
when these animals lived the climate was mild, a very natural inference,
since the elephants and rhinoceroses we now know are all inhabitants of
tropical climes. But the discovery of more or less complete specimens
makes it evident that the climate was
not particularly mild; the animals were simply adapted to it; instead of
being naked like their modern relatives, they were dressed for the
climate in a woolly covering. We think of the tiger as prowling through
the jungles of India, but he ranges so far north that in some localities
this beast preys upon reindeer, which are among the most northern of
large mammals, and there the tiger is clad in fairly thick fur. When we come to coloring a reconstructed animal we have absolutely no
guide, unless we assume that the larger a creature the more soberly will
it be colored. The great land animals of to-day, the elephant and
rhinoceros, to say nothing of the aquatic hippopotamus, are very dully
colored, and while this sombre coloration is to-day a protection,
rendering these animals less easily seen by man than they otherwise
would be, yet at the time this color was developing man was not nor were
there enemies sufficiently formidable to menace the race of elephantine
creatures. For where mere size furnishes sufficient protection one would hardly
expect to find protective
coloration as well, unless indeed a creature preyed upon others, when it
might be advantageous to enable a predatory animal to steal upon its
prey. Color often exists (or is supposed to) as a sexual characteristic, to
render the male of a species attractive to, or readily recognizable by,
the female, but in the case of large animals mere size is quite enough
to render them conspicuous, and possibly this may be one of the factors
in the dull coloration of large animals. So while a green and yellow Triceratops would undoubtedly have been a
conspicuous feature in the Cretaceous landscape, from what we know of
existing animals it seems best to curb our fancy and, so far as large
Dinosaurs are concerned, employ the colors of a Rembrandt rather than
those of a sign painter. Aids, or at least hints, to the coloration of extinct animals are to
be found in the coloration of the young of various living species, for
as the changes undergone by the embryo are in a measure an epitome of
the changes undergone by a species during its evolution, so the brief
color phases or markings of the young are
considered to represent the ordinary coloring of distant ancestors. Young thrushes are spotted, young ostriches and grebes are irregularly
striped, young lions are spotted, and in restoring the early horse, or
Hyracothere, Professor Osborn had the animal represented as faintly
striped, for the reason that zebras, the wild horses of to-day, are
striped, and because the ass, which is a primitive type of horse, is
striped over the shoulders, these being hints that the earlier
horse-like forms were also striped. Thus just as the skeleton of a Dinosaur may be a composite structure,
made up of the bones of a dozen individuals, and these in turn mosaics
of many fragments, so may the semblance of the living animal be based on
a fact, pieced out with a probability and completed by a bit of
theory. REFERENCES

There is a large series of restorations of extinct animals,
prepared by Mr. Charles R. Knight, under the direction of Professor
Osborn, in the Hall of PalÃ¦ontology of the American Museum of Natural
History, and
these are later to be reproduced and issued in portfolio form. Should the reader visit Princeton, he may see in the museum there
a number of B. Waterhouse Hawkins's creations–creations is the proper
word–which are of interest as examples of the early work in this
line. The "Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1900" contains an
article on "The Restoration of Extinct Animals," pages 479-492, which
includes a number of plates showing the progress that has been made in
this direction. Fig.
