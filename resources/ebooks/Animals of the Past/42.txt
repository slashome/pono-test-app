13.–ArchÃ¦opteryx, the Earliest Known Bird. So far as flight goes, there is one entire order of mammals, whose
members, the bats, are quite as much at home in the air as the birds
themselves, and in bygone days the empire of the air belonged to the
pterodactyls; even frogs and fishes have tried to fly, and some of the
latter have nearly succeeded in the attempt. As for wings, it may be
said that they are made on very different patterns in such animals as
the pterodactyl, bat, and bird, and that while the end to be achieved is
the same, it is reached by very different methods. The wing membrane of
a bat is spread between his out-stretched
fingers, the thumb alone being left free, while in the pterodactyl the
thumb is wanting and the membrane supported only by what in us is the
little finger, a term that is a decided misnomer in the case of the
pterodactyl. In birds the fingers have lost their individuality, and are
modified for the attachment or support of the wing feathers, but in
ArchÃ¦opteryx the hand had not reached this stage, for the fingers were
partly free and tipped with claws. Fig. 14.–Nature's Four Methods of Making a Wing. Bat, Pterodactyl,
ArchÃ¦opteryx, and Modern Bird. We get some side lights on the structure of primitive birds by
studying the young and the earlier stages of living species, for in a
very general way it may be said that the development of the individual
is a sort of rough sketch or hasty outline of the development of the
class of which it is a member; thus the transitory stages through which
the chick passes before hatching give us some idea of the structure of
the adult birds or bird-like creatures of long ago. Now, in embryonic
birds the wing ends in a sort of paw and the fingers are separate, quite
different from what they become a little later on, and not unlike their
condition in
ArchÃ¦opteryx, and even more like what is found in the wing of an
ostrich. Then, too, there are a few birds still left, such as the ostrich,
that have not kept pace with the others, and are a trifle more like
reptiles than the vast majority of their relatives, and these help a
little in explaining the structure of early birds. Among these is a
queer bird with a queer name, Hoactzin, found in South America, which
when young uses its little wings much like legs, just as we may suppose
was done by birds of old, to climb about the branches. Mr. Quelch, who
has studied these curious birds in their native wilds of British Guiana,
tells us that soon after hatching, the nestlings begin to crawl about by
means of their legs and wings, the well-developed claws on the thumb and
finger being constantly in use for hooking to surrounding objects. If
they are drawn from the nest by means of their legs, they hold on firmly
to the twigs, both with their bill and wings; and if the nest be upset
they hold on to all objects with which they come in contact by bill,
feet, and wings, making considerable use of the bill, with the help of
the clawed wings, to raise themselves to a higher level. Fig. 15.–Young Hoactzins. Thus, by putting these various facts together we obtain some pretty
good ideas regarding the appearance and habits of the first birds. The
immediate ancestors of birds, their exact point of
departure from other vertebrates, is yet to be discovered; at one time
it was considered that they were the direct descendants of Dinosaurs, or
that at least both were derived from the same parent forms, and while
that view was almost abandoned, it is again being brought forward with
much to support it. It has also been thought that birds and those flying
reptiles, the pterodactyls, have had a common ancestry, and the
possibility of this is still entertained. Be that as it may, it is safe
to consider that back in the past, earlier than the Jurassic, were
creatures neither bird nor reptile, but possessing rudimentary feathers
and having the promise of a wing in the structure of their fore legs,
and some time one of these animals may come to light; until then
ArchÃ¦opteryx remains the earliest known bird. In the Jurassic, then, when the Dinosaurs were the lords of the earth
and small mammals just beginning to appear, we come upon traces of
full-fledged birds. The first intimation of their presence was the
imprint of a single feather found in that ancient treasure-house, the
Solenhofen quarries; but as Hercules was revealed by
his foot, so the bird was made evident by the feather whose discovery
was announced August 15, 1861. And a little later, in September of the
same year, the bird itself turned up, and in 1877 a second specimen was
found, the two representing two species, if not two distinct genera. These were very different from any birds now living–so different,
indeed, and bearing such evident traces of their reptilian ancestry,
that it is necessary to place them apart from other animals in a
separate division of the class birds. ArchÃ¦opteryx was considerably smaller than a crow, with a stout
little head armed with sharp teeth (as scarce as hens' teeth was no joke
in that distant period), while as he fluttered through the air he
trailed after him a tail longer than his body, beset with feathers on
either side. Everyone knows that nowadays the feathers of a bird's tail
are arranged like the sticks of a fan, and that the tail opens and shuts
like a fan. But in ArchÃ¦opteryx the feathers were arranged in pairs, a
feather on each side of every joint of the tail, so that on a small
scale the tail was something like that of a
kite; and because of this long, lizard-like tail this bird and his
immediate kith and kin are placed in a group dubbed SaururÃ¦, or lizard
tailed. Because impressions of feathers are not found all around these
specimens some have thought that they were confined to certain portions
of the body–the wings, tail, and thighs–the other parts being naked. There seems, however, no good reason to suppose that such was the case,
for it is extremely improbable that such perfect and important feathers
as those of the wings and tail should alone have been developed, while
there are many reasons why the feathers of the body might have been lost
before the bird was covered by mud, or why their impressions do not
show. It was a considerable time after the finding of the first specimen
that the presence of teeth in the jaws was discovered, partly because
the British Museum specimen was imperfect,[6] and partly because no one suspected
that birds had ever possessed teeth, and so no one ever looked for
them. When, in 1877, a more complete example was found, the existence of
teeth was unmistakably shown; but in the meantime, in February, 1873,
Professor Marsh had announced the presence of teeth in Hesperornis, and
so to him belongs the credit of being the discoverer of birds with
teeth. [6] The skull was
lacking, and a part of the upper jaw lying to one side was thought to
belong to a fish. The next birds that we know are from our own country, and although
separated by an interval of thousands of years from the Jurassic
ArchÃ¦opteryx, time enough for the members of one group to have quite
lost their wings, they still retain teeth, and in this respect the most
bird-like of them is quite unlike any modern bird. These come from the
chalk beds of western Kansas, and the first specimens were obtained by
Professor Marsh in his expeditions of 1870 and 1871, but not until a few
years later, after the material had been cleaned and was being studied,
was it ascertained that these birds were armed with teeth. The smaller
of these birds, which was apparently not unlike a small gull in general
appearance, was, saving its teeth, so thoroughly a bird that it may be
passed by without further notice, but the larger was remarkable in
many ways. Hesperornis, the western bird, was a great diver, in some
ways the greatest of the divers, for it stood higher than the king
penguin, though more slender and graceful in general build, looking
somewhat like an overgrown, absolutely wingless loon. The penguins, as everyone knows, swim with their front limbs–we can't
call them wings–which, though containing all the bones of a wing, have
become transformed into powerful paddles; Hesperornis, on the other
hand, swam altogether with its legs–swam so well with them, indeed, that
through disuse the wings dwindled away and vanished, save one bone. This, however, is not stating the theory quite correctly; of course the
matter cannot be actually proved. Hesperornis was a large bird, upwards
of five feet in length, and if its ancestors were equally bulky their
wings were quite too large to be used in swimming under water, as are
those of such short-winged forms as the Auks which fly under the water
quite as much as they fly over it. Hence the wings were closely folded
upon the body so as to offer the least possible resistance, and being
disused, they and
their muscles dwindled, while the bones and muscles of the legs
increased by constant use. By the time the wings were small enough to be
used in so dense a medium as water the muscles had become too feeble to
move them, and so degeneration proceeded until but one bone remained, a
mere vestige of the wing that had been. The penguins retain their great
breast muscles, and so did the Great Auk, because their wings are used
in swimming, since it requires even more strength to move a small wing
in water than it does to move a large wing in the thinner air. As for
our domesticated fowls–the turkeys, chickens, and ducks–there has not
been sufficient lapse of time for their muscles to dwindle, and besides
artificial selection, the breeding of fowls for food has kept up the
mere size of the muscles, although these lack the strength to be found
in those of wild birds. As a swimming bird, one that swims with its legs and not with its
wings, Hesperornis has probably never been equalled, for the size and
appearance of the bones indicate great power, while the bones of the
foot were so joined to those
of the leg as to turn edgewise as the foot was brought forward and thus
to offer the least possible resistance to the water. It is a remarkable
fact that the leg bones of Hesperornis are hollow, remarkable because as
a rule the bones of aquatic animals are more or less solid, their weight
being supported by the water; but those of the great diver were almost
as light as if it had dwelt upon the dry land. That it did not dwell
there is conclusively shown by its build, and above all by its feet, for
the foot of a running bird is modified in quite another way. The bird was probably covered with smooth, soft feathers, something
like those of an Apteryx; this we know because Professor Williston found
a specimen showing the impression of the skin of the lower part of the
leg as well as of the feathers that covered the "thigh" and head. While
such a covering seems rather inadequate for a bird of such exclusively
aquatic habits as Hesperornis must have been, there seems no getting
away from the facts in the case in the shape of Professor Williston's
specimen, and we have in the Snake Bird, one of the
most aquatic of recent birds, an instance of similarly poor covering. As
all know who have seen this bird at home, its feathers shed the water
very imperfectly, and after long-continued submersion become saturated,
a fact which partly accounts for the habit the bird has of hanging
itself out to dry. Fig. 16.–Hesperornis, the Great Toothed Diver. The restoration which Mr. Gleeson has drawn differs radically from
any yet made, and is the result of a careful study of the specimen
belonging to the United States National Museum. No one can appreciate
the peculiarities of Hesperornis and its remarkable departures from
other swimming birds who has not seen the skeleton mounted in a swimming
attitude. The great length of the legs, their position at the middle of
the body, the narrowness of the body back of the hip joint, and the
disproportionate length of the outer toe are all brought out in a manner
which a picture of the bird squatting upon its haunches fails utterly to
show. As for the tail, it is evident from the size and breadth of the
bones that something of the kind was present; it is also evident that it
was not like that of an ordinary bird, and so it
has been drawn with just a suggestion of ArchÃ¦opteryx about it. The most extraordinary thing about Hesperornis, however, is the
position of the legs relative to the body, and this is something that
was not even suspected until the skeleton was mounted in a swimming
attitude. As anyone knows who has watched a duck swim, the usual place
for the feet and legs is beneath and in a line with the body. But in our
great extinct diver the articulations of the leg bones are such that
this is impossible, and the feet and lower joint of the legs (called the
tarsus) must have stood out nearly at right angles to the body, like a
pair of oars. This is so peculiar and anomalous an attitude for a bird's
legs that, although apparently indicated by the shape of the bones, it
was at first thought to be due to the crushing and consequent distortion
to which the bones had been subjected, and an endeavor was made to place
the legs in the ordinary position, even though this was done at the
expense of some little dislocation of the joints. But when the mounting
of the skeleton had advanced further it became more
evident that Hesperornis was not an ordinary bird, and that he could not
have swum in the usual manner, since this would have brought his great
knee-caps up into his body, which would have been uncomfortable. And so,
at the cost of some little time and trouble,[7] the mountings were so changed that
the legs stood out at the sides of the body, as shown in the
picture. [7] The mounting
of fossil bones is quite a different matter from the wiring of an
ordinary skeleton, since the bones are not only so hard that they cannot
be bored and wired like those of a recent animal, but they are so
brittle and heavy that often they will not sustain their own weight. Hence such bones must be supported from the outside, and to do this so
that the mountings will be strong enough to support their weight, allow
the bones to be removed for study, and yet be inconspicuous, is a
difficult task. A final word remains to be said about toothed birds, which is, that
the visitor who looks upon one for the first time will probably be
disappointed. The teeth are so loosely implanted in the jaw that most of
them fall out shortly after death, while the few that remain are so
small as not to attract observation. By the time the Eocene Period was reached, even before that, birds
had become pretty much what we now see them, and very little change
has taken place in them since that time; they seem to have become so
exactly adapted to the conditions of existence that no further
modification has taken place. This may be expressed in another way, by
saying that while the Mammals of the Eocene have no near relatives among
those now living, entire large groups having passed completely out of
existence, the few birds that we know might, so far as their appearance
and affinities go, have been killed yesterday. Were we to judge of the former abundance of birds by the number we
find in a fossil state, we should conclude that in the early days of the
world they were remarkably scarce, for bird bones are among the rarest
of fossils. But from the high degree of development evidenced by the few
examples that have come to light, and the fact that these represent
various and quite distinct species,[8] we are led to
conclude that birds were abundant enough, but that we simply do not find
them. [8] But three
birds, besides a stray feather or two, are so far known from the Eocene
of North America. One of these is a fowl not very unlike some of the
small curassows of South America; another is a little bird, supposed to
be related to the sparrows, while the third is a large bird of uncertain
relationships. Several eggs, too–or, rather, casts of eggs–have lately been found in
the Cretaceous and Miocene strata of the West; and, as eggs and birds
are usually associated, we are liable at any time to come upon the bones
of the birds that laid them. To the writer's mind no thoroughly satisfactory explanation has been
given for the scarcity of bird remains; but the reason commonly advanced
is that, owing to their lightness, dead birds float for a much longer
time than other animals, and hence are more exposed to the ravages of
the weather and the attacks of carrion-feeding animals. It has also been
said that the power of flight enabled birds to escape calamities that
caused the death of contemporary animals; but all birds do not fly; and
birds do fall victims to storms, cold, and starvation, and even perish
of pestilence, like the Cormorants of Bering Island, whose ranks have
twice been decimated by disease. It is true that where carnivorous animals abound, dead birds do
disappear quickly; and my
friend Dr. Stejneger tells me that, while hundreds of dead sea-fowl are
cast on the shores of the Commander Islands, it is a rare thing to find
one after daylight, as the bodies are devoured by the Arctic foxes that
prowl about the shores at night. But, again, as in the Miocene of
Southern France and in the Pliocene of Oregon, remains of birds are
fairly numerous, showing that, under proper conditions, their bones are
preserved for future reference, so that we may hope some day to come
upon specimens that will enable us to round out the history of bird life
in the past. REFERENCES
