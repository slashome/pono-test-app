28.–Relics of the Moa. From the bones we learn that there were a great many kinds of Moas,
twenty at least, ranging in size from those little larger than a turkey
to that giant among giants, Dinornis maximus, which stood at
least ten feet high,[10]  or
two feet higher than the largest ostrich, and may well claim the
distinction of being the tallest of all known birds. We also learn from
the bones that not only were the Moas flightless, but that many of them
were absolutely wingless, being devoid even of such vestiges of wings as
we find in the Cassowary or Apteryx. But if Nature deprived these birds
of wings, she made ample amends in the matter of legs, those of some
species, the Elephant-footed Moa, Pachyornis elephantopus, for
example, being so massively built as to cause one to wonder what the
owner used them for, although the generally accepted theory is that they
were used for scratching up the roots of ferns on which the Moas are
believed to have fed. And if a blow from an irate ostrich is sufficient
to fell a man, what must have been the kicking power of an able-bodied
Moa? Beside this bird the ostrich would appear as slim and graceful as a
gazelle beside a prize ox. [10] The height of
the Moas, and even of some species of Ãpyornis, is often stated to be
twelve or fourteen feet, but such a height can only be obtained by
placing the skeleton in a wholly unnatural attitude. The Moas were confined to New Zealand, some species inhabiting the
North Island, some the South, very few being common to both, and from
these peculiarities of distribution
geologists deduce that at some early period in the history of the earth
the two islands formed one, that later on the land subsided, leaving the
islands separated by a strait, and that since this subsidence there has
been sufficient time for the development of the species peculiar to each
island. Although Moas were still numerous when man made his appearance
in this part of the world, the large deposits of their bones indicate
that they were on the wane, and that natural causes had already reduced
the feathered population of these islands. A glacial period is believed
to have wrought their destruction, and in one great morass, abounding in
springs, their bones occur in such enormous numbers, layer upon layer,
that it is thought the birds sought the place where the flowing springs
might afford their feet at least some respite from the biting cold, and
there perished miserably by thousands. What Nature spared man finished, and legends of Moa hunts and Moa
feasts still lingered among the Maoris when the white man came and began
in turn the extermination of the Maori. The theory has been
advanced, with
much to support it, that the big birds were eaten off the face of the
earth by an earlier race than the Maoris, and that after the extirpation
of the Moas the craving for flesh naturally led to cannibalism. But by
whomsoever the destruction was wrought, the result was the same, the
habitat of these feathered giants knew them no longer, while multitudes
of charred bones, interspersed with fragments of egg-shells, bear
testimony to former barbaric feasts. It is a far cry from New Zealand to Madagascar, but thither must we
go, for that island was, pity we cannot say is, inhabited by a race of
giant birds from whose eggs it has been thought may have been hatched
the Roc of Sindbad. Arabian tales, as we all know, locate the Roc either
in Madagascar or in some adjacent island to the north and east, and it
is far from unlikely that legends of the Ãpyornis, backed by the
substantial proof of its enormous eggs, may have been the slight
foundation of fact whereon the story-teller erected his structure of
fiction. True, the Roc of fable was a gigantic bird of prey capable
of
bearing away an elephant in its talons, while the Ãpyornis has shed its
wings and shrunk to dimensions little larger than an ostrich, but this
is the inevitable result of closer acquaintance and the application of a
two-foot rule. Like the Moa the Ãpyornis seems to have lived in tradition long after
it became extinct, for a French history of Madagascar, published as
early as 1658 makes mention of a large bird, or kind of ostrich, said to
inhabit the southern end of the island. Still, in spite of bones having
been found that bear evident traces of the handiwork of man, it is
possible that this and other reports were due to the obvious necessity
of having some bird to account for the presence of the eggs. The actual introduction of the Ãpyornis to science took place in
1834, when a French traveller sent Jules Verreaux, the ornithologist, a
sketch of a huge egg, saying that he had seen two of that size, one
sawed in twain to make bowls, the other, traversed by a stick, serving
in the preparation of rice uses somewhat in contrast with the proverbial
fragility of egg-shells. A little later another traveller
procured some fragments of egg-shells, but it was not until 1851 that
any entire eggs were obtained, when two were secured, and with a few
bones sent to France, where Geoffroy St. Hilaire bestowed upon them the
name of Ãpyornis maximus (the greatest lofty bird). Maximus the
eggs remain, for they still hold the record for size; but so far as the
bird that is supposed to have laid them is concerned, the name was a
little premature, for other and larger species subsequently came to
hand. Between the Ãpyornithes and the Moas Science has had a hard time,
for the supply of big words was not large enough to go around, and some
had to do duty twice. In the way of generic names we have Dinornis,
terrible bird; Ãpyornis, high bird; Pachyornis, stout bird; and
Brontornis, thunder bird, while for specific names there are robustus,
maximus, titan; gravis, heavy; immanis, enormous; crassus, stout;
ingens, great; and elephantopus, elephant-footed–truly a goodly array of
large-sounding words. But to return to the big eggs! Usually we look
upon those of the ostrich as pretty large, but an ostrich egg
measures
4-1/2 by 6 inches, while that of the Ãpyornis is 9 by 13 inches; or, to
put it another way, it would hold the contents of six ostrichs' eggs, or
one hundred and forty-eight hens' eggs, or thirty thousand humming
birds' eggs; and while this is very much smaller than a waterbutt, it is
still as large as a bucket, and one or two such eggs might suffice to
make an omelet for Gargantua himself. The size of an egg is no safe criterion of the size of the bird that
laid it, for a large bird may lay a small egg, or a small bird a large
one. Comparing the egg of the great Moa with that of our Ãpyornis one
might think the latter much the larger bird, say twelve feet in height,
when the facts in the case are that while there was no great difference
in the weight of the two, that difference, and a superiority of at least
two feet in height, are in favor of the bird that laid the smaller egg. The record of large eggs, however, belongs to the Apteryx, a New Zealand
bird smaller than a hen, though distantly related to the Moas, which
lays an egg about one-third of its own weight, measuring 3 by 5 inches;
perhaps it
is not to be wondered at that the bird lays but two. Although most of the eggs of these big birds that have been found
have literally been unearthed from the muck of swamps, now and then one
comes to light in a more interesting manner as, for example, when a
perfect egg of Ãpyornis was found afloat after a hurricane, bobbing
serenely up and down with the waves near St. Augustine's Bay, or when an
egg of the Moa was exhumed from an ancient Maori grave, where for years
it had lain unharmed, safely clasped between the skeleton fingers of the
occupant. So far very few of these huge eggs have made their way to this
country, and the only egg of Ãpyornis now on this side of the water is
the property of a private individual. Most recent in point of discovery, but oldest in point of time, are
the giant birds from Patagonia, which are burdened with the name of
PhororhacidÃ¦, a name that originated in an error, although the error may
well be excused. The first fragment of one of these great birds to come
to light was a portion of the lower jaw, and this was so massive, so
un-bird-like,  that
the finder dubbed it Phororhacos, and so it must remain. Fig. 29.–Eggs of Feathered Giants, Ãpyornis, Ostrich, Moa, Compared with
a Hen's Egg. It is a pity that all the large names were used up before this group
of birds was discovered, and it is particularly unfortunate that
Dinornis, terrible bird, was applied to the root-eating Moas, for these
Patagonian birds, with their massive limbs, huge heads and hooked beaks,
were truly worthy of such a name; and although in nowise related to the
eagles, they may in habit have been terrestrial birds of prey. Not all
the members of this family are giants, for as in other groups, some are
big and some little, but the largest among them might be styled the
Daniel Lambert of the feathered race. Brontornis, for example,
the thunder bird, or as the irreverent translate it, the thundering big
bird, had leg-bones larger than those of an ox, the drumstick measuring
30 inches in length by 2-1/2 inches in diameter, or 4-1/4 inches across
the ends, while the tarsus, or lower bone of the leg to which the toes
are attached, was 16-1/2 inches long and 5-1/2 inches wide where the
toes join on. Bear this in mind the next time you see a large turkey, or
compare these bones  with
those of an ostrich: but lest you may forget, it may be said that the
same bone of a fourteen-pound turkey is 5-1/2 inches long, and one inch
wide at either end, while that of an ostrich measures 19 inches long and
2 inches across the toes, or 3 at the upper end. If Brontornis was a heavy-limbed bird, he was not without near rivals
among the Moas, while the great Phororhacos, one of his contemporaries,
was not only nearly as large, but quite unique in build. Imagine a bird
seven or eight feet in height from the sole of his big, sharp-clawed
feet, to the top of his huge head, poise this head on a neck as thick as
that of a horse, arm it with a beak as sharp as an icepick and almost as
formidable, and you have a fair idea of this feathered giant of the
ancient pampas. The head indeed was truly colossal for that of a bird,
measuring 23 inches in length by 7 in depth, while that of the racehorse
Lexington, and he was a good-sized horse, measures 22 inches long by
5-1/2 inches deep. The depth of the jaw is omitted because we wish to
make as good a case as possible for the bird, and the jaw of a horse is
so deep
as to give him an undue advantage in that respect. Fig. 30.–Skull of Phororhacos Compared with that of the Race-horse
Lexington. We can only speculate on the food of these great birds, and for aught
we know to the contrary they may have caught fish, fed upon carrion, or
used their powerful feet and huge beaks for grubbing roots; but if they
were not more or less carnivorous, preying upon such reptiles, mammals
and other birds as came within reach, then nature apparently made a
mistake in giving them such a formidable equipment of beak and claw. So
far as habits go
we might be justified in calling them cursorial birds of prey. Fig. 31.–Leg of a Horse Compared with that of the Giant Moa. We really know very little about these Patagonian giants, but they
are interesting not only from their great size and astounding skulls,
but because of the early age (Miocene) at which they lived and because
in spite of their bulk they are in nowise related to the ostriches, but
belong near the heron family. As usual, we have no idea why they became
extinct, but
in this instance man is guiltless, for they lived and died long before
he made his appearance, and the ever-convenient hypothesis "change of
climate" may be responsible for their disappearance. climate with their accompanying variations in the supply of food, and,
to a lesser extent, against their various enemies, including man. This
power of flight, acquired early in their geological history, has enabled
birds to spread over the length and breadth of the globe as no other
group of animals has done, and to thrive under the most varying
conditions, and it would seem that if this power were lost it must
sooner or later work harm. Now to-day we find no great wingless birds in
thickly populated regions, or where beasts of prey abound; the ostriches
roam the desert wastes of Arabia, Africa and South America where men are
few and savage beasts scarce, and against these is placed a fleetness of
foot inherited from ancestors who acquired it before man was. The heavy
cassowaries dwell in the thinly inhabited, thickly wooded islands of
Malaysia, where again there are no large carnivores and where the dense
vegetation is some safeguard against man; the emu comes from the
Australian plains, where also there are no four-footed enemies

[11] and where his ancestors

dwelt
in peace before the advent of man. And the same things are true of the
Moas, the Ãpyornithes, the flightless birds of Patagonia, the recent
dodo of Mauritius and the solitaire of Rodriguez, each and all of which
flourished in places where there were no men and practically no other
enemies. Hence we deduce that absence of enemies is the prime factor in
the existence of flightless birds,

[12] although presence of food is an
essential, while isolation, or restriction to a limited area, plays an
important part by keeping together those birds, or that race of birds,
whose members show a tendency to disuse their wings. It will be seen
that such combinations of circumstances will most naturally be found on
islands whose geological history is such that they have had no
connection with adjacent continents, or such a very ancient connection
that they were not then peopled with beasts of prey, while subsequently
their distance from other countries has prevented them from receiving
such

population
by accident in recent times and has also retarded the arrival of
man. [11] The dingo, or
native dog, is not forgotten, but, like man, it is a comparatively
recent animal. [12] Note that in
Tasmania, which is very near Australia, both in space and in the
character of its animals, there are two carnivorous mammals, the
Tasmanian "Wolf" and the Tasmanian Devil, and no flightless
birds. Once established, flightlessness and size play into one another's
hands; the flightless bird has no limit placed on its size[13] while granted a food supply and
immunity from man; the larger the bird the less the necessity for wings
to escape from four-footed foes. So long as the climate was favorable
and man absent, the big, clumsy bird might thrive, but upon the coming
of man, or in the face of any unfavorable change of climate, he would be
at a serious disadvantage and hence whenever either of these two factors
has been brought to bear against them the feathered giants have
vanished. [13] While we do
not know the limit of size to a flying creature, none has as yet been
found whose wings would spread over twenty feet from tip to tip, and it
is evident that wings larger than this would demand great strength for
their manipulation. REFERENCES

There is a fine collection of mounted skeletons of various
species of Moas in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge,
Mass., and another in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. A few 
other skeletons and numerous bones are to be found in other
institutions, but the author is not aware of any egg being in this
country. Specimens of the Ãpyornis are rare in this country, but Mr. Robert Gilfort, of Orange, N.J., is the possessor of a very fine egg. A
number of eggs have been sold in London, the prices ranging from Â£200
down to Â£42, this last being much less than prices paid for eggs of the
great auk. But then, the great auk is somewhat of a fad, and there are
just enough eggs in existence to bring one into the market every little
while. Besides, the number of eggs of the great auk is a fixed quantity,
while no one knows how many more of Ãpyornis remain to be discovered in
the swamps of Madagascar. No specimens of the gigantic Patagonian birds
are now in this country, but a fine example of one of the smaller forms,
Pelycornis, including the only breast-bone yet found, is in the Museum
of Princeton University. The largest known tibia of a Moa, the longest bird-bone known, is
in the collection of the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand;
it is 3 feet 3 inches long. This, however, is exceptional, the
measurements of the leg-bones of an ordinary Dinornis maximus being as
follows: Femur, 18 inches; tibia, 32 inches; tarsus, 19 inches, a total
of 5 feet 9 inches. The egg measures 10-1/2 by 6-1/2 inches. There is plenty of literature, and very interesting
literature, about the Moas, but, unfortunately, the best of it is not
always accessible, being contained in the "New Zealand Journal of
Science" and the "Transactions of the New Zealand Institute." The volume
of "Transactions" for 1893, being vol. xxvi., contains a very full list
of articles relating to the Moas, compiled by Mr. A. Hamilton; it will
be found to commence on page 229. There is a good article on Moa in
Newton's "Dictionary of Birds," a book that should be in every
library. Fig.
