W. Beehler has exhumed bones representing several
hundred individuals, varying in size from a mere baby mastodon up to the
great tusker whose wornout teeth proclaim that he had reached the limit
of even mastodonic old age. The spot where this remarkable deposit was
found is at the foot of a bluff near the junction of two little streams,
and it seems probable that in the days when these were larger the spring
floods swept down the bodies of animals that had perished during the
winter to ground in an
eddy beneath the bluff. Or as the place abounds in springs of sulphur
and salt water it may be that this was where the animals assembled
during cold weather, just as the moas are believed to have gathered in
the swamps of New Zealand, and here the weaker died and left their
bones. The mastodon must have looked very much like any other elephant,
though a little shorter in the legs and somewhat more heavily built than
either of the living species, while the head was a trifle flatter and
the jaw decidedly longer. The tusks are a variable quantity, sometimes
merely bowing outwards, often curving upwards to form a half circle;
they were never so long as the largest mammoth tusks, but to make up for
this they were a shade stouter for their length. As the mastodon ranged
well to the north it is fair to suppose that he may have been covered
with long hair, a supposition that seems to be borne out by the
discovery, noted by Rembrandt Peale, of a mass of long, coarse, woolly
hair buried in one of the swamps of Ulster County, New York. And with
these facts in mind, aided by photographs  of
various skeletons of mastodons, Mr. Gleeson made the restoration which
accompanies this chapter. Fig.
