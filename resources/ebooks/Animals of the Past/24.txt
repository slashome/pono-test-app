That they are infallibly correct is out of the
question; for, as Dr. Woodward writes in the preface to "Extinct
Monsters," "restorations are ever liable to emendation, and the present
... will certainly prove no exception to the rule." As a striking
instance of this, it was found necessary at the last moment to change
the figure of Hesperornis, the original life-like portrait proving to be
incorrect in attitude, a fact that would have long escaped detection but
for the Pan-American Exposition. The
connection between the two is explained on page 76. However, the reader
may rest assured that these restorations are infinitely more nearly
correct than many figures of living animals that have appeared within
the last twenty-five years, and are even now doing duty. The endeavor has been made to indicate, at the end of each
chapter, the museums in which the best examples of the animals described
may be seen, and also some book or article in which further information
may be obtained. As this book is intended for the general reader,
references to purely technical articles have, so far as possible, been
avoided, and none in foreign languages mentioned. For important works of reference on the subject of paleontology,
the reader may consult "A Manual of Paleontology," by Alleyne Nicholson
and R. Lydekker, a work in two volumes dealing with invertebrates,
vertebrates, and plants, or "A Text-Book of Paleontology," by Karl von
Zittel, English edition, only the first volume of which has so far been
published. An admirable book on the vertebrates is "Outlines of
Vertebrate Paleontology," by Arthur Smith Woodward. It is to be
understood that these are not at all "popular" in their scope, but
intended for students who are already well advanced in the study of
zoÃ¶logy. ANIMALS OF THE PAST

FOSSILS, AND HOW THEY ARE FORMED

"How of a thousand snakes each one
Was changed into a coil of stone."

Fossils are the remains, or even the indications, of animals and
plants that have, through natural agencies, been buried in the earth and
preserved for long periods of time. This may seem a rather meagre
definition, but it is a difficult matter to frame one that will be at
once brief, exact, and comprehensive; fossils are not necessarily the
remains of extinct animals or plants, neither are they, of necessity,
objects that have become petrified or turned into stone. Bones of the Great Auk and Rytina, which are quite extinct, would
hardly be considered as fossils; while the bones of many species of
animals, still living, would properly come in that category, having long
ago been buried by natural causes and often been changed into stone. And yet it is not essential for a specimen to have had its animal matter
replaced by some mineral in order that it may be classed as a fossil,
for the Siberian Mammoths, found entombed in ice, are very properly
spoken of as fossils, although the flesh of at least one of these
animals was so fresh that it was eaten. Likewise the mammoth tusks
brought to market are termed fossil-ivory, although differing but little
from the tusks of modern elephants. Many fossils indeed merit their popular appellation of petrifactions,
because they have been changed into stone by the slow removal of the
animal or vegetable matter present and its replacement by some mineral,
usually silica or some form of lime. But it is necessary to include
'indications of plants or animals' in the above definition because some
of the best fossils may be merely impressions of plants or animals and
no portion of the objects themselves, and yet, as we shall see, some of
our most important information has been gathered from these same
imprints. Nearly all our knowledge of the plants that flourished in the past is
based on the impressions of
their leaves left on the soft mud or smooth sand that later on hardened
into enduring stone. Such, too, are the trails of creeping and crawling
things, casts of the burrows of worms and the many footprints of the
reptiles, great and small, that crept along the shore or stalked beside
the waters of the ancient seas. The creatures themselves have passed
away, their massive bones even are lost, but the prints of their feet
are as plain to-day as when they were first made. Many a crustacean, too, is known solely or mostly by the cast of its
shell, the hard parts having completely vanished, and the existence of
birds in some formations is revealed merely by the casts of their eggs;
and these natural casts must be included in the category of fossils. Impressions of vertebrates may, indeed, be almost as good as actual
skeletons, as in the case of some fishes, where the fine mud in which
they were buried has become changed to a rock, rivalling porcelain in
texture; the bones have either dissolved away or shattered into dust at
the splitting of the rock, but the
imprint of each little fin-ray and every threadlike bone is as clearly
defined as it would have been in a freshly prepared skeleton. So fine,
indeed, may have been the mud, and so quiet for the time being the
waters of the ancient sea or lake, that not only have prints of bones
and leaves been found, but those of feathers and of the skin of some
reptiles, and even of such soft and delicate objects as jelly fishes. But for these we should have little positive knowledge of the outward
appearance of the creatures of the past, and to them we are occasionally
indebted for the solution of some moot point in their anatomy. The reader may possibly wonder why it is that fossils are not more
abundant; why, of the vast majority of animals that have dwelt upon the
earth since it became fit for the habitation of living beings, not a
trace remains. This, too, when some objects–the tusks of the Mammoth,
for example–have been sufficiently well preserved to form staple
articles of commerce at the present time, so that the carved handle of
my lady's parasol may have formed part of some animal that flourished at
the very dawn  of the
human race, and been gazed upon by her grandfather a thousand times
removed. The answer to this query is that, unless the conditions were
such as to preserve at least the hard parts of any creature from
immediate decay, there was small probability of its becoming fossilized. These conditions are that the objects must be protected from the air,
and, practically, the only way that this happens in nature is by having
them covered with water, or at least buried in wet ground.
