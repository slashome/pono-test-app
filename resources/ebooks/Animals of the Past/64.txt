40.–The Mastodon. As for the size of the mastodon, this, like that of the mammoth, is
popularly much over-estimated, and it is more than doubtful if any
attained the height of a full-grown African elephant. The largest femur,
or thigh-bone, that has come under the writer's notice was one he
measured as it lay in the earth at Kimmswick, and this was just four
feet long, three inches shorter than the thigh-bone of Jumbo. Several of
the largest thigh-bones measured show so striking an unanimity in size,
between 46 and 47 inches in length, that we may be pretty sure they
represent the average old "bull" mastodon, and if we say that these
animals stood ten feet high we are probably doing them full justice. An
occasional tusk reaches a length of ten feet, but seven or eight is the
usual size, with a diameter of as many inches, and this is no larger
than the tusks of the African elephant would grow if they had a chance. It is painful to be obliged to scale down the mastodon as we have  just
done the mammoth, but if any reader knows of specimens larger than those
noted, he should by all means publish their measurements.[20]

[20] As skeletons
are sometimes mounted, they stand a full foot or more higher at the
shoulders than the animal stood in life, this being caused by raising
the body until the shoulder-blades are far below the tips of the
vertebrÃ¦, a position they never assume in life. The disappearance of the mastodon is as difficult to account for as
that of the mammoth, and, as will be noted, there is absolutely no
evidence to show that man had any hand in it. Neither can it be ascribed
to change of climate, for the mastodon, as indicated by the wide
distribution of its bones, was apparently adapted to a great diversity
of climates, and was as much at home amid the cool swamps of Michigan
and New York as on the warm savannas of Florida and Louisiana. Certainly
the much used, and abused, glacial epoch cannot be held accountable for
the extermination of the creature, for the mastodon came into New York
after the recession of the great ice-sheet, and tarried to so late a
date that bones buried in the
swamps retain much of their animal matter. So recent, comparatively
speaking, has been the disappearance of the mastodon, and so
fresh-looking are some of its bones, that Thomas Jefferson thought in
his day that it might still be living in some part of the then
unexplored Northwest. It is a moot question whether or not man and the mastodon were
contemporaries in North America, and while many there be who, like the
writer of these lines, believe that this was the case, an expression of
belief is not a demonstration of fact. The best that can be said is that
there are scattered bits of testimony, slight though they are, which
seem to point that way, but no one so strong by itself that it could not
be shaken by sharp cross-questioning and enable man to prove an alibi in
a trial by jury.
