THE ANCESTRY OF THE HORSE

I am going to be a horse

To run my earthly course."

The American whose ancestors came over in the "Mayflower" has a
proper pride in the length of the line of his descent. The Englishman
whose genealogical tree sprang up at the time of William the Conqueror
has, in its eight centuries of growth, still larger occasion for pluming
himself on the antiquity of his family. But the pedigree of even the
latter is a thing of yesterday when compared with that of the horse,
whose family records, according to Professor Osborn, reach backward for
something like 2,000,000 years. And if, as we have been told, "it is a
good thing to have ancestors, but sometimes a little hard on the
ancestor," in this
instance at least the founders of the family have every reason to regard
their descendants with undisguised pride. For the horse family started
in life in a small way, and the first of the line, the Hyracotherium,
was "a little animal no bigger than a fox, and on five[14] toes he scampered over Tertiary
rocks," in the age called Eocene, because it was the morning of life for
the great group of mammals whose culminating point was man. At that
time, western North America was a country of many lakes, for the most
part comparatively shallow, around the reedy margins of which moved a
host of animals, quite unlike those of to-day, and yet foreshadowing
them, the forerunners of the rhinoceros, tapir, and the horse. [14] Four, to be
exact; but we prefer to sacrifice the foot of the Hyracothere rather
than to take liberties with one of the feet of Mrs. Stetson's
poem. The early horse–we may call him so by courtesy, although he was then
very far from being a true horse–was an insignificant little creature,
apparently far less likely to succeed in life's race than his bulky
competitors, and yet, by making the most of their opportunities, his
descendants have survived, while most of theirs have dropped by the
wayside; and finally, by the aid of man, the horse has become spread
over the length and breadth of the habitable globe. Fig. 33.–Skeleton of the Modern Horse and of His Eocene Ancestor. Now right here it may be asked, How do we know that the little
Hyracothere was the
progenitor of the horse, and how can it be shown that there is any bond
of kinship between him and, for example, the great French Percheron? There is only one way in which we can obtain this knowledge, and but one
method by which the relationship can be shown, and that is by collecting
the fossil remains of animals long extinct and comparing them with the
bones of the recent horse, a branch of science known as PalÃ¦ontology. It
has taken a very long time to gather the necessary evidence, and it has
taken a vast amount of hard work in our western Territories, for "the
country that is as hot as Hades, watered by stagnant alkali pools, is
almost invariably the richest in fossils." Likewise it has called for
the expenditure of much time and more patience to put together some of
this petrified evidence, fragmentary in every sense of the word, and get
it into such shape that it could be handled by the anatomist. Still, the
work has been done, and, link by link, the chain has been constructed
that unites the horse of to-day with the horse of very many
yesterdays. The very first links in this chain are the remains of
the bronze age and those found among the ruins of the ancient Swiss lake
dwellings; but earlier still than these are the bones of horses found
abundantly in northern Europe, Asia, and America. The individual bones
and teeth of some of these horses are scarcely distinguishable from
those of to-day, a fact noted in the name, Equus fraternus,
applied to one species; and when teeth alone are found, it is at times
practically impossible to say whether they belong to a fossil horse or
to a modern animal. But when enough scattered bones are gathered to make
a fairly complete skeleton, it becomes evident that the fossil horse had
a proportionately larger head and smaller feet than his existing
relative, and that he was a little more like an ass or zebra, for the
latter, spite of his gay coat, is a near relative of the lowly ass. Moreover, primitive man made sketches of the primitive horse, just as he
did of the mammoth, and these indicate that the horse of those days was
something like an overgrown Shetland pony, low and heavily built,
large-headed and rough-coated. For the old cave-dwellers of Europe were
intimately acquainted with
the prehistoric horses, using them for food, as they did almost every
animal that fell beneath their flint arrows and stone axes. And if one
may judge from the abundance of bones, the horses must have roamed about
in bands, just as the horses escaped from civilization roam, or have
roamed, over the pampas of South America and the prairies of the
West. The horse was just as abundant in North America in Pleistocene time
as in Europe; but there is no evidence to show that it was contemporary
with early man in North America, and, even were this the case, it is
generally believed that long before the discovery of America the horse
had disappeared. And yet, so plentiful and so fresh are his remains, and
so much like those of the mustang, that the late Professor Cope was wont
to say that it almost seemed as if the horse might have
lingered in Texas until the coming of the white man. And Sir William
Flower wrote: "There is a possibility of the animal having still
existed, in a wild state, in some parts of the continent remote from
that which was first visited by the Spaniards, where they were
certainly
unknown. It has been suggested that the horses which were found by Cabot
in La Plata in 1530 cannot have been introduced."

Still we have not the least little bit of positive proof that such
was the case, and although the site of many an ancient Indian village
has been carefully explored, no bones of the horse have come to light,
or if they have been found, bones of the ox or sheep were also present
to tell that the village was occupied long after the advent of the
whites. It is also a curious fact that within historic times there have
been no wild horses, in the true sense of the word, unless indeed those
found on the steppes north of the Sea of Azof be wild, and this is very
doubtful. But long before the dawn of history the horse was domesticated
in Europe, and CÃ¦sar found the Germans, and even the old Britons, using
war chariots drawn by horses–for the first use man seems to have made of
the horse was to aid him in killing off his fellow-man, and not until
comparatively modern times was the animal employed in the peaceful arts
of agriculture. The immediate predecessors of these horses were
considerably
smaller, being about the size and build of a pony, but they were very
much like a horse in structure, save that the teeth were shorter. As
they lived during Pliocene times, they have been named "Pliohippus."

Going back into the past a step farther, though a pretty long step if
we reckon by years, we come upon a number of animals very much like
horses, save for certain cranial peculiarities and the fact that they
had three toes on each foot, while the horse, as every one knows, has
but one toe. Now, if we glance at the skeleton of a horse, we will see
on either side of the canon-bone, in the same situation as the upper
part of the little toes of the Hippotherium, as these three-toed horses
are called, a long slender bone, termed by veterinarians the splint
bone; and it requires no anatomical training to see that the bones in
the two animals are the same. The horse lacks the lower part of his side
toes, that is all, just as man will very probably some day lack the last
bones of his little toe. We find an approach to this condition in some
of the Hippotheres even, known as Protohippus, in which the side
toes are
quite small, foreshadowing the time when they shall have disappeared
entirely. It may also be noted here that the splint bones of the horses
of the bronze age are a little longer than those of existing horses, and
that they are never united with the large central toe, while nowadays
there is something of a tendency for the three bones to fuse into one,
although part of this tendency the writer believes to be due to
inflammation set up by the strain of the pulling and hauling the animal
is now called upon to do. Some of these three-toed Hippotheres are not
in the direct line of ancestry of the horse, but are side branches on
the family tree, having become so highly specialized in certain
directions that no further progress horseward was possible. Backward still, and the bones we find in the Miocene strata of the
West, belonging to those ancestors of the horse to which the name of
Mesohippus has been given because they are midway in time and structure
between the horse of the past and present, tell us that then all horses
were small and that all had three toes on a foot, while the fore feet
bore even
the suggestion of a fourth toe. From this to our Eocene Hyracothere with
four toes is only another long-time step. We may go even beyond this in
time and structure, and carry back the line of the horse to animals
which only remotely resembled him and had five good toes to a foot; but
while these contained the possibility of a horse, they made no show of
it. Fig. 34.–The Development of the Horse. Increase in size and decrease in number of the
toes were not the only changes that were required to transform the
progeny of the Hyracothere into a horse. These are the most evident; but
the increased complexity in the structure of the teeth was quite as
important. The teeth of gnawing animals have often been compared to a
chisel which is made of a steel plate with soft iron backing, and the
teeth of a horse, or of other grass-eating animals, are simply an
elaboration of this idea. The hard
enamel, which represents the steel, is set in soft dentine, which
represents the iron, and in use the dentine wears away the faster of the
two, so that the enamel stands up in ridges, each tooth becoming, as it
is correctly termed, "a grinder." In a horse the plates of enamel form
curved, complex, irregular patterns; but as we go back in time, the
patterns become less and less elaborate, until in the Hyracothere,
standing at the foot of the family tree, the teeth are very simple in
structure. Moreover, his teeth were of limited growth, while those of
the horse grow for a considerable time, thus compensating for the wear
to which they are subjected. We have, then, this direct evidence as to the genealogy of the horse,
that between the little Eocene Hyracothere and the modern horse we can
place a series of animals by which we can pass by gradual stages from
one to the other, and that as we come upward there is an increase in
stature, in the complexity of the teeth, and in the size of the brain. At the same time, the number of toes decreases, which tells that the
animals were
developing more and more speed; for it is a rule that the fewer the toes
the faster the animal: the fastest of birds, the ostrich, has but two
toes, and one of these is mostly ornamental; and the fastest of mammals,
the horse, has but one. All breeders of fancy stock, particularly of pigeons and poultry,
recognize the tendency of animals to revert to the forms whence they
were derived and reproduce some character of a distant ancestor; to
"throw back," as the breeders term it. If now, instead of reproducing a
trait or feature possessed by some ancestor a score, a hundred, or
perhaps a thousand years ago, there should reappear a characteristic of
some ancestor that flourished 100,000 years back, we should have a
seeming abnormality, but really a case of reversion; and the more we
become acquainted with the structure of extinct animals and the
development of those now living, the better able are we to explain these
apparent abnormalities. Bearing in mind that the two splint bones of the horse correspond to
the upper portions of the side toes of the Hippotherium and
Mesohippus, it is easy to see that if for any reason these should
develop into toes, they would make the foot of a modern horse appear
like that of his distant ancestor. While such a thing rarely happens,
yet now and then nature apparently does attempt to reproduce a horse's
foot after the ancient pattern, for occasionally we meet with a horse
having, instead of the single toe with which the average horse is
satisfied, one or possibly two extra toes. Sometimes the toe is extra in
every sense of the word, being a mere duplication of the central toe;
but sometimes it is an actual development of one of the splint bones. No
less a personage than Julius CÃ¦sar possessed one of these polydactyl
horses, and the reporters of the Daily Roman and the
Tiberian Gazette doubtless wrote it up in good journalistic
Latin, for we find the horse described as having feet that were almost
human, and as being looked upon with great awe. While this is the most
celebrated of extra-toed horses, other and more plebeian individuals
have been much more widely known through having been exhibited
throughout the country under such
titles as "Clique, the horse with six feet," "the eight-footed Cuban
horse," and so on; and possibly some of these are familiar to readers of
this page. So the collateral evidence, though scanty, bears out the
circumstantial proof, derived from fossil bones, that the horse has
developed from a many-toed ancestor; and the evidence points toward the
little Hyracothere as being that ancestor. It remains only to show some
good reason why this development should have taken place, or to indicate
the forces by which it was brought about.
