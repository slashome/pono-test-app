We have heard much about "the
survival of the fittest," a phrase which simply means that those animals
best adapted to their surroundings will survive, while those ill adapted
will perish. But it should be added that it means also that the animals
must be able to adapt themselves to changes in their environment, or to
change with it. Living beings cannot stand still indefinitely; they must
progress or perish. And this seems to have been the cause for the
extinction of the huge quadrupeds that flourished at the time of the
three-toed Miocene
horse. They were adapted to their environment as it was; but when the
western mountains were thrust upward, cutting off the moist winds from
the Pacific, making great changes in the rainfall and climate to the
eastward of the Rocky Mountains, these big beasts, slow of foot and dull
of brain, could not keep pace with the change, and their race vanished
from the face of the earth. The day of the little Hyracothere was at the
beginning of the great series of changes by which the lake country of
the West, with its marshy flats and rank vegetation, became transformed
into dry uplands sparsely clad with fine grasses. On these dry plains
the more nimble-footed animals would have the advantage in the struggle
for existence; and while the four-toed foot would keep its owner from
sinking in soft ground, he was handicapped when it became a question of
speed, for not only is a fleet animal better able to flee from danger
than his slower fellows, but in time of drouth he can cover the greater
extent of territory in search of food or water. So, too, as the rank
rushes gave place to fine grasses, often
browned and withered beneath the summer's sun, the complex tooth had an
advantage over that of simpler structure, while the cutting-teeth, so
completely developed in the horse family, enabled their possessors to
crop the grass as closely as one could do it with scissors. Likewise, up
to a certain point, the largest, most powerful animal will not only
conquer, or escape from, his enemies, but prevail over rivals of his own
kind as well, and thus it came to pass that those early members of the
horse family who were preÃ«minent in speed and stature, and harmonized
best with their surroundings, outstripped their fellows and transmitted
these qualities to their progeny, until, as a result of long ages of
natural selection, there was developed the modern horse. The rest man
has done: the heavy, slow-paced dray horse, the fleet trotter, the huge
Percheron, and the diminutive pony are one and all the recent products
of artificial selection. REFERENCES

The best collection of fossil horses, and one specially arranged
to illustrate the line of descent of the modern horse, is to be found in
the American Museum of Natural History, New York, but some good
specimens, of particular interest because they were described by
Professor Marsh and studied by Huxley are in the Yale University Museum. They are referred to in Huxley's "American Addresses; Lectures on
Evolution." "The Horse," by Sir W. H. Flower, discusses the horse in a
popular manner from various points of view and contains numerous
references to books and articles on the subject from which anyone
wishing for further information could obtain it. Fig. 35.–The Mammoth. THE MAMMOTH

In the October number of McClure's Magazine for 1899 was
published a short story, "The Killing of the Mammoth," by "H. Tukeman,"
which, to the amazement of the editors, was taken by many readers not as
fiction, but as a contribution to natural history. Immediately after the
appearance of that number of the magazine, the authorities of the
Smithsonian Institution, in which the author had located the remains of
the beast of his fancy, were beset with visitors to see the stuffed
mammoth, and the daily mail of the Magazine, as well as that of the
Smithsonian Institution, was filled with inquiries for more information
and for requests to settle wagers as to whether it was a true story or
not. The contribution in question was printed purely as fiction, with no
idea of misleading the public, and was entitled a story in the table of
contents. We doubt if any writer of realistic fiction ever had a more
general and convincing proof of success. About three centuries ago, in 1696, a Russian, one Ludloff by name,
described some bones 
belonging to what the Tartars called "Mamantu"; later on, Blumenbach
pressed the common name into scientific use as "Mammut," and Cuvier
gallicized this into "Mammouth," whence by an easy transition we get our
familiar mammoth. We are so accustomed to use the word to describe
anything of remarkable size that it would be only natural to suppose
that the name Mammoth was given to the extinct elephant because of its
extraordinary bulk. Exactly the reverse of this is true, however, for
the word came to have its present meaning because the original possessor
of the name was a huge animal. The Siberian peasants called the creature
"Mamantu," or "ground-dweller," because they believed it to be a
gigantic mole, passing its life beneath the ground and perishing when by
any accident it saw the light. The reasoning that led to this belief was
very simple and the logic very good; no one had ever seen a live
Mamantu, but there were plenty of its bones lying at or near the
surface; consequently if the animal did not live above the ground, it
must dwell below. mammoth was a sort of big, hairy elephant, now extinct, and nearly every
one has a general idea that it lived in the North. There is some
uncertainty as to whether the mammoth was a mastodon, or the mastodon a
mammoth, and there is a great deal of misconception as to the size and
abundance of this big beast. It may be said in passing that the mastodon
is only a second or third cousin of the mammoth, but that the existing
elephant of Asia is a very near relative, certainly as near as a first
cousin, possibly a very great grandson. Popularly, the mammoth is
supposed to have been a colossus somewhere from twelve to twenty feet in
height, beside whom modern elephants would seem insignificant; but as
"trout lose much in dressing," so mammoths shrink in measuring, and
while there were doubtless Jumbos among them in the way of individuals
of exceptional magnitude, the majority were decidedly under Jumbo's
size. The only mounted mammoth skeleton in this country, that in the
Chicago Academy of Sciences, is one of the largest, the thigh-bone
measuring five feet one inch in length, or a foot more than that of
Jumbo;

and
as Jumbo stood eleven feet high, the rule of three applied to this
thigh-bone would give the living animal a height of thirteen feet eight
inches. The height of this specimen is given as thirteen feet in its
bones, with an estimate of fourteen feet in its clothes; but as the
skeleton is obviously mounted altogether too high, it is pretty safe to
say that thirteen feet is a good, fair allowance for the height of this
animal when alive. As for the majority of mammoths, they would not
average more than nine or ten feet high. Sir Samuel Baker tells us that
he has seen plenty of wild African elephants that would exceed Jumbo by
a foot or more, and while this must be accepted with caution, since
unfortunately he neglected to put a tape-line on them, yet Mr. Thomas
Baines did measure a specimen twelve feet high. This, coupled with Sir
Samuel's statement, indicates that there is not so much difference
between the mammoth and the elephant as there might be. This applies to
the mammoth

Hemisphere and occur abundantly in Siberia and Alaska. There were other
elephants than the mammoth, and some that exceeded him in size, notably

inches long, and weighed 176 pounds. The largest, most beautiful tusks,
probably, ever seen in this country were a pair brought from Zanzibar
and displayed by Messrs. Tiffany & Company in 1900. The measurements
and weights of these were as follows: length along outer curve, ten feet
and three-fourths of an inch, circumference one foot, eleven inches,
weight, 224 pounds; length along outer curve, ten feet, three and
one-half inches, circumference two feet and one-fourth of an inch,
weight, 239 pounds. For our knowledge of the external appearance of the mammoth we are
indebted to the more or less entire examples which have been found at
various times in Siberia, but mainly to the noted specimen found in 1799
near the Lena, embedded in the ice, where it had been reposing, so
geologists tell us, anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 years. How the
creature gradually thawed out of its icy tomb, and the tusks were taken
by the discoverer and sold for ivory; how the dogs fed upon the flesh in
summer, while bears and wolves feasted upon it in winter; how the animal
was within an ace
of being utterly lost to science when, at the last moment, the mutilated
remains were rescued by Mr. Adams, is an old story, often told and
retold. Suffice it to say that, besides the bones, enough of the beast
was preserved to tell us exactly what was the covering of this
ancient elephant, and to show that it was a creature adapted to
withstand the northern cold and fitted for living on the branches of the
birch and hemlock. Fig. 36.–Skeleton of the Mammoth in the Royal Museum of St. Petersburg. The exact birthplace of the mammoth is as uncertain as that of many
other great characters; but his earliest known resting-place is in the
Cromer Forest Beds of England, a country inhabited by him at a time when
the German Ocean was dry land and Great Britain part of a peninsula. Here his remains are found to-day, while from the depths of the North
Sea the hardy trawlers have dredged hundreds, aye thousands, of mammoth
teeth in company with soles and turbot. If, then, the mammoth originated
in western Europe, and not in that great graveyard of fossil elephants,
northern India, eastward he went spreading over all Europe north of the
Pyrenees and Alps, save only Scandinavia, whose glaciers offered no
attractions, scattering his bones abundantly by the wayside to serve as
marvels for future ages. Strange indeed have been some of the tales to
which these and other elephantine remains have given rise when they came
to light in the good
old days when knowledge of anatomy was small and credulity was great. The least absurd theory concerning them was that they were the bones of
the elephants which Hannibal brought from Africa. Occasionally they were
brought forward as irrefutable evidences of the deluge; but usually they
figured as the bones of giants, the most famous of them being known as
Teutobochus, King of the Cimbri, a lusty warrior said to have had a
height of nineteen feet. Somewhat smaller, but still of respectable
height, fourteen feet, was "Littell Johne" of Scotland, whereof Hector
Boece wrote, concluding, in a moralizing tone, "Be quilk (which) it
appears how extravegant and squaire pepill grew in oure regioun afore
they were effeminat with lust and intemperance of mouth." More than
this, these bones have been venerated in Greece and Rome as the remains
of pagan heroes, and later on worshipped as relics of Christian saints. Did not the church of Valencia possess an elephant tooth which did duty
as that of St. Christopher, and, so late as 1789, was not a thigh-bone,
figuring as the arm-bone of a saint, carried in
procession through the streets in order to bring rain? Out of Europe eastward into Asia the mammoth took his way, and having
peopled that vast region, took advantage of a land connection then
existing between Asia and North America and walked over into Alaska, in
company with the forerunners of the bison and the ancestors of the
mountain sheep and Alaskan brown bear. Still eastward and southward he
went, until he came to the Atlantic coast, the latitude of southern New
York roughly marking the southern boundary of the broad domain over
which the mammoth roamed undisturbed.[15] Not that of necessity all this vast
area was occupied at one time; but this was the range of the mammoth
during Pleistocene time, for over all this region his bones and teeth
are found in greater or less abundance and in varying conditions of
preservation. In regions like parts of Siberia and Alaska, where the
bones are entombed in a wet and cold, often icy, soil, the bones and
tusks are almost as perfectly preserved as though they had been
deposited but a score of years ago, while remains so situated that they
have been subjected to varying conditions of dryness and moisture are
always in a fragmentary state. As previously noted, several more or less
entire carcasses of the mammoth have been discovered in Siberia, only to
be lost; and, while no entire animal has so far been found in Alaska,
some day one may yet come to light. That there is some possibility of
this is shown by the discovery, recorded by Mr. Dall, of the partial
skeleton of a mammoth in the bank of the Yukon with some of the fat
still present, and although this had been partially converted into
adipocere, it was fresh enough to be used by the natives for greasing,
not their boots, but their boats. And up to the present time this is the
nearest approach to finding a live mammoth in Alaska. [15] This must be
taken as a very general statement, as the distinction between and
habitats of Elephas primigenius and Elephas columbi, the southern
mammoth, are not satisfactorily determined; moreover, the two species
overlap through a wide area of the West and Northwest. As to why the mammoth became extinct, we know absolutely
nothing, although various theories, some much more ingenious than
plausible, have
been advanced to account for their extermination–they perished of
starvation; they were overtaken by floods on their supposed migrations
and drowned in detachments; they fell through the ice, equally in
detachments, and were swept out to sea. But all we can safely say is
that long ages ago the last one perished off the face of the earth. Strange it is, too, that these mighty beasts, whose bulk was ample to
protect them against four-footed foes, and whose woolly coat was proof
against the cold, should have utterly vanished. They ranged from England
eastward to New York, almost around the world; from the Alps to the
Arctic Ocean; and in such numbers that to-day their tusks are articles
of commerce, and fossil ivory has its price current as well as wheat. Mr. Boyd Dawkins thinks that the mammoth was actually exterminated by
early man, but, even granting that this might be true for southern and
western Europe, it could not be true of the herds that inhabited the
wastes of Siberia, or of the thousands that flourished in Alaska and the
western United States. So far as man is concerned, the
mammoth might still be living in these localities, where, before the
discovery of gold drew thousands of miners to Alaska, there were vast
stretches of wilderness wholly untrodden by the foot of man. Neither
could this theory account for the disappearance of the mastodon from
North America, where that animal covered so vast a stretch of territory
that man, unaided by nature, could have made little impression on its
numbers. That many were swept out to sea by the flooded rivers of
Siberia is certain, for some of the low islands off the coast are said
to be formed of sand, ice, and bones of the mammoth, and thence, for
hundreds of years, have come the tusks which are sold in the market
beside those of the African and Indian elephants. preserving the salient features. We see the curved tusks, the snaky
trunk, and the shaggy coat that we know belonged to the mammoth, and we
may feel assured that if early man did not conquer the clumsy creature
with fire and flint, he yet gazed upon him from the safe vantage point
of some lofty tree or inaccessible rock, and then went home to tell his
wife and neighbors how the animal escaped because his bow missed fire. That man and mammoth lived together in North America is uncertain; so
far there is no evidence to show that they did, although the absence of
such evidence is no proof that they did not. That any live mammoth has
for centuries been seen on the Alaskan tundras is utterly improbable,
and on Mr. C.
