Hatcher, which weighed, when boxed, 3,650
pounds. Or, as the result of some mishap, or through the work of an
inexperienced collector, a valuable specimen may arrive in the shape of
a box full of irregular fragments of stone compared with which a
dissected map or an old-fashioned Chinese puzzle is simplicity itself,
and one may spend hours looking for some piece whose proper location
gives the clew to an entire section, and days, even, may be consumed
before the task is completed. While this not only tries the patience,
but the eyes as well, there is, nevertheless, a fascination about this
work of fashioning a bone out of scores, possibly hundreds, of
fragments, and watching the irregular bits of stone shaping themselves
into a mosaic that forms a portion of some creature, possibly quite new
to science, and destined to bear a name as long as itself. And thus,
after many days of toil, the bone that millions of years before sank
into the mud of some old lake-bottom or was
buried in the sandy shoals of an ancient river, is brought to light once
more to help tell the tale of the creatures of the past. One bone might convey a great deal of information; on the other hand
it might reveal very little; for, while it is very painful to say so,
the popular impression that it is possible to reconstruct an animal from
a single bone, or tell its size and habits from a tooth is but partially
correct, and sometimes "the eminent scientist" has come to grief even
with a great many bones at his disposal. Did not one of the ablest
anatomists describe and figure the hip-bones of a Dinosaur as its
shoulder-blade, and another, equally able, reconstruct a reptile "hind
side before," placing the head on the tail! This certainly sounds absurd
enough; but just as absurd mistakes are made by men in other walks of
life, often with far more deplorable results. Before passing to the restoration of the exterior of animals it may
be well to say something of the manner in which the skeleton of an
extinct animal may be reconstructed and the meaning of its various parts
interpreted. For
the adjustment of the muscles is dependent on the structure of the
skeleton, and putting on the muscles means blocking out the form,
details of external appearance being supplied by the skin and its
accessories of hair, scales, or horns. Let us suppose in the present
instance that we are dealing with one of the great reptiles known as
Triceratops whose remains are among the treasures of the National Museum
at Washington, for the reconstruction of the big beast well illustrates
the methods of the palÃ¦ontologist and also the troubles by which he is
beset. Moreover, this is not a purely imaginary case, but one that is
very real, for the skeleton of this animal which was shown at Buffalo
was restored in papier-machÃ© in exactly the manner indicated. We have a
goodly number of bones, but by no means an entire skeleton, and yet we
wish to complete the skeleton and incidentally to form some idea of the
creature's habits. Now we can interpret the past only by a knowledge of
the present, and it is by carefully studying the skeletons of the
animals of to-day that we can learn to read the meaning of the symbols
of
bones left by the animals of a million yesterdays. Thus we find that
certain characters distinguish the bone of a mammal from that of a bird,
a reptile, or a fish, and these in turn from one another, and this
constitutes the A B C of comparative anatomy. And, in a like manner, the
bones of the various divisions of these main groups have to a greater or
less extent their own distinguishing characteristics, so that by first
comparing the bones of extinct animals with those of creatures that are
now living we are enabled to recognize their nearest existing relative,
and then by comparing them with one another we learn the relations they
bore in the ancient world. But it must be borne in mind that some of the
early beasts were so very different from those of to-day that until
pretty much their entire structure was known there was nothing with
which to compare odd bones. Had but a single incomplete specimen of
Triceratops come to light we should be very much in the dark concerning
him; and although remains of some thirty individuals have been
discovered, these have been so imperfect that we are very far from
having all the information we need. A great part of the head, with its
formidable looking horns, is present, and although the nose is gone, we
know from other specimens that it, too, was armed with a knob, or horn,
and that the skull ended in a beak, something like that of a snapping
turtle, though formed by a separate and extra bone; similarly the end of
the lower jaw is lacking, but we may be pretty certain that it ended in
a beak, to match that of the skull. The large leg-bones of our specimen
are mostly represented, for these being among the more solid parts of
the skeleton are more frequently preserved than any others, and though
some are from one side and some from another, this matters not. If the
hind legs were disproportionately long it would indicate that our animal
often or habitually walked erect, but as there is only difference enough
between the fore and hind limbs to enable Triceratops to browse
comfortably from the ground we would naturally place him on all fours,
even were the skull not so large as to make the creature too top-heavy
for any other mode of locomotion. Were the limbs very
small in comparison with the other bones, it would obviously mean that
their owner passed his life in the water. For a skeleton has a twofold
meaning, it is the best, the most enduring, testimony we have as to an
animal's place in nature and the relationships it sustains to the
creatures that lived with it, before it, and after it. More than this, a
skeleton is the solution of a problem in mechanics, the problem of
carrying a given weight and of adaptation to a given mode of life. Thus
the skeleton varies according as a creature dwells on land, in the
water, or in the air, and according as it feeds on grass or preys upon
its fellows. And so the mechanics of a skeleton afford us a clew to the habits of
the living animal. Something, too, may be gathered from the structure of
the leg-bones, for solid bones mean either a sluggish animal or a
creature of more or less aquatic habits, while hollow bones emphatically
declare a land animal, and an active one at that; and this, in the case
of the Dinosaurs, hints at predatory habits, the ability to catch and
eat their defenceless and more sluggish brethren. A claw, or, better
yet, a tooth, may
confirm or refute this hint; for a blunt claw could not be used in
tearing prey limb from limb, nor would a double-edged tooth, made for
rending flesh, serve for champing grass. But few bones of the feet, and especially the fore feet, are present,
these smaller parts of the skeleton having been washed away before the
ponderous frame was buried in the sand, and the best that can be done is
to follow the law of probabilities and put three toes on the hind foot
and five on the fore, two of these last without claws. The single blunt
round claw among our bones shows, as do the teeth, that Triceratops was
herbivorous; it also pointed a little downward, and this tells that in
the living animal the sole of the foot was a thick, soft pad, somewhat
as it is in the elephant and rhinoceros, and that the toes were not
entirely free from one another. There are less than a dozen vertebrÃ¦ and
still fewer ribs, besides half a barrelful of pieces, from which to
reconstruct a backbone twenty feet long. That the ribs are part from one
side and part from another matters no more than it did in the case of
the leg-bones; but the backbone presents a more
difficult problem, since the pieces are not like so many checkers–all
made after one pattern–but each has an individuality of its own. The
total number of vertebrÃ¦ must be guessed at (perhaps it would sound
better to say estimated, but it really means the same), and knowing that
some sections are from the front part of the vertebral column and some
from the back, we must fill in the gaps as best we may. The ribs offer a
little aid in this task, giving certain details of the vertebrÃ¦, while
those in turn tell something about the adjoining parts of the ribs. We
finish our Triceratops with a tail of moderate length, as indicated by
the rapid taper of the few vertebrÃ¦ available, and from these we gather,
too, that in life the tail was round, and not flattened, and that it
neither served for swimming nor for a balancing pole. And so, little by
little, have been pieced together the fragments from which we have
derived our knowledge of the past, and thus has the palÃ¦ontologist read
the riddles of the rocks. Fig. 26.–Triceratops, He of the Three-horned Face. To make these dry bones live again, to clothe them with flesh and
reconstruct the 
creature as he was or may have been in life, is, to be honest, very
largely guesswork, though to make a guess that shall come anywhere near
the mark not only demands a thorough knowledge of anatomy–for the basis
of all restoration must be the skeleton–but calls for more than a
passing acquaintance with the external appearance of living animals. And
while there is nothing in the bones to tell how an animal is, or was,
clad, they will at least show to what group the creature belonged, and,
that known, there are certain probabilities in the case. A bird, for
example, would certainly be clad in feathers. Going a little farther, we
might be pretty sure that the feathers of a water-fowl would be thick
and close; those of strictly terrestrial birds, such as the ostrich and
other flightless forms, lax and long. These as general propositions; of
course, in special cases, one might easily come to grief, as in dealing
with birds like penguins, which are particularly adapted for an aquatic
life, and have the feathers highly modified. These birds depend upon
their fat, and not on their feathers, for warmth, and so 
their feathers have become a sort of cross between scales and hairs. Hair and fur belong to mammals only, although these creatures show much
variety in their outer covering. The thoroughly marine whales have
discarded furs and adopted a smooth and slippery skin,[9] well adapted to movement through the
water, relying for warmth on a thick undershirt of blubber. The earless
seals that pass much of their time on the ice have just enough hair to
keep them from absolute contact with it, warmth again being provided for
by blubber. The fur seals, which for several months in the year dwell
largely on land, have a coat of fur and hair, although warmth is mostly
furnished, or rather kept in, by fat. [9] The reader is
warned that this is a mere figure of speech, for, of course, the process
of adaptation to surroundings is passive, not active, although there is
a most unfortunate tendency among writers on evolution, and particularly
on mimicry, to speak of it as active. The writer believes that no animal
in the first stages of mimicry, consciously mimics or endeavors to
resemble another animal or any part of its surroundings, but a habit at
first accidental may in time become more or less conscious. No reptile, therefore, would be covered with feathers,
neither, judging from those we know to-day, would they be clad in fur or
hair; but, such coverings being barred out, there remain a great variety
of plates and scales to choose from. Folds and frills, crests and
dewlaps, like beauty, are but skin deep, and, being thus superficial,
ordinarily leave no trace of their former presence, and in respect to
them the reconstructor must trust to his imagination, with the law of
probabilities as a check rein to his fancy. This law would tell us that
such ornaments must not be so placed as to be in the way, and that while
there would be a possibility–one might even say probability–of the
great, short-headed, iguana-like Dinosaurs having dewlaps, that there
would be no great likelihood of their possessing ruffs such as that of
the Australian Chlamydosaurus (mantled lizard) to flap about their ears. Even Stegosaurus, with his bizarre array of great plates and spines,
kept them on his back, out of the way. Such festal ornamentation would,
however, more likely be found in small, active creatures, the larger
beasts contenting themselves with plates and folds. Spines and plates usually leave some trace of their existence, for
they consist of a super-structure of skin or horn, built on a foundation
of bone; and while even horn decomposes too quickly to "petrify," the
bone will become fossilized and changed into enduring stone. But while
this affords a pretty sure guide to the general shape of the investing
horn, it does not give all the details, and there may have been ridges
and furrows and sculpturing that we know not of. Knowing, then, what the probabilities are, we have some guide to the
character of the covering that should be placed on an animal, and if we
may not be sure as to what should be done, we may be pretty certain what
should not. For example, to depict a Dinosaur with smooth, rubbery hide walking
about on dry land would be to violate the probabilities, for only such
exclusively aquatic creatures as the whales among mammals, and the
salamanders among batrachians, are clothed in smooth, shiny skin. There
might, however, be reason to suspect that a creature largely aquatic in
its habits did occasionally venture on land, as, for
instance, when vertebrÃ¦ that seem illy adapted for carrying the weight
of a land animal are found in company with huge limb-bones and massive
feet we may feel reasonably certain that their owner passed at least a
portion of his time on terra firma. So much for the probabilities as to the covering of animals known to
us only by their fossil remains; but it is often possible to go beyond
this, and to state certainly how they were clad. For while the chances
are small that any trace of the covering of an extinct animal, other
than bony plates, will be preserved, Nature does now and then seem to
have relented, and occasionally some animal settled to rest where it was
so quickly and quietly covered with fine mud that the impression of
small scales, feathers, or even smooth skin, was preserved; curiously
enough, there seems to be scarcely any record of the imprint of hair. Then, too, it is to be remembered that while the chances were very much
against such preservation, in the thousands or millions of times
creatures died the millionth chance might come uppermost. Silhouettes of those marine reptiles, the Ichthyosaurs, have been
found, probably made by the slow carbonization of animal matter, showing
not only the form of the body and tail, but revealing the existence of
an unsuspected back fin. And yet these animals were apparently clad in a
skin as thin and smooth as that of a whale. Impressions of feathers were
known long before the discovery of ArchÃ¦opteryx; a few have been found
in the Green River and Florissant shales of Wyoming, and a Hesperornis
in the collection of the State University of Kansas shows traces of the
existence of long, soft feathers on the legs and very clear imprints of
the scales and reticulated skin that covered the tarsus. From the Chalk
of Kansas, too, came the example of Tylosaur, showing that the back of
this animal was decorated with the crest shown in Mr. Knight's
restoration, one not unlike that of the modern iguana. From the Laramie
sandstone of Montana Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Butler have obtained the
impressions of portions of the skin of the great Dinosaur, Thespesius,
which show that the covering of this animal consisted largely, if
not
entirely, of small, irregularly hexagonal horny scutes, slightly
thickened in the centre. The quarries of lithographic stone at
Solenhofen have yielded a few specimens of flying reptiles,
pterodactyls, which not only verify the correctness of the inference
that these creatures possessed membranous wings, like the bats, but show
the exact shape, and it was sometimes very curious, of this membrane. And each and all of these wonderfully preserved specimens serve both to
check and guide the restorer in his task of clothing the animal as it
was in life.
