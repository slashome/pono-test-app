Knight. The
fact that the originals of these drawings have been presented to and
accepted by the United States National Museum is evidence of their
scientific value. Mr. Knight has been commissioned by the Smithsonian
Institution, the United States National Museum, and the New York Museum
of Natural History, to do their most important pictures of extinct
animals. He is the one modern artist who can picture prehistoric animals
with artistic charm of presentation as well as with full scientific
accuracy. In this instance, the author has personally superintended the
artist's work, so that it is as correct in every respect as present
knowledge makes possible. Of the minor illustrations, some are by Mr. Bruce Horsfall, an artist attached to the staff of the New York Museum
of Natural History, and all have been drawn with the help of and under
the author's supervision. LIST OF
