We do not
know. Did they devour everything large enough to be eaten throughout
their habitat, and then fall to eating one another? Again, we do not
know. But perish they did, while the smaller white shark, which came
into being at the same time, still lives, as if to emphasize the fact
that it is best not to overdo things, and that in the long run the
victory is not always to the largest. REFERENCES

The finest Mosasaur skeleton ever discovered, an almost complete
skeleton of Tylosaurus dyspelor, 29 feet in length, may be seen at the
head of the staircase leading to the Hall of Paleontology, in the
American Museum of Natural History, New York. Another good specimen may
be seen in the Yale University Museum, which probably has the largest
collection of Mosasaurs in existence. Another fine collection is in the
Museum of the State University of Kansas, at Lawrence. The best Zeuglodon, the first to show the vestigial hind legs and
to make clear other portions of the structure, is in the United States
National Museum. The great sharks are known in this country by their teeth only,
and, as these are common in the phosphate beds,
specimens may be seen in almost any collection. In the United States
National Museum, the jaws of a twelve-foot blue shark are shown for
comparison. The largest tooth in that collection is 5-3/4 inches high
and 5 inches across the base. It takes five teeth of the blue shark to
fill the same number of inches. The Mosasaurs are described in detail by Professor S.
