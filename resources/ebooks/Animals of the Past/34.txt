Charles Schuchert collected a series of
specimens for the National Museum, from which it was possible to restore
the entire skeleton. Owing to a rather curious circumstance the first
attempt at a restoration was at fault; among the bones originally
obtained by Mr. Schuchert there were none from the last half of the
tail, an old gully having cut off the hinder portion of the backbone and
destroyed the vertebrÃ¦. Not far away, however, was a big lump of stone
containing several vertebrÃ¦ of just the right size, and these were used
as models to complete the papier-machÃ© skeleton shown at Atlanta, in
1894. But a year after Mr. Schuchert collected a series of vertebrÃ¦,
beginning with the tip of the tail, and these showed conclusively that
the first lot of tail vertebrÃ¦ belonged to a creature still
undescribed and
one probably more like a whale than Zeuglodon himself, whose exact
relationships are a little uncertain, as may be imagined from what was
said of its structure. Mixed with the bones of Zeuglodon was the shell
of a turtle, nearly three feet long, and part of the backbone of a great
water-snake that must have been twenty-five feet long, both previously
quite unknown. One more curious thing about Zeuglodon bones remains to
be told, and then we are done with him; ordinarily a fossil bone will
break indifferently in any direction, but the bones of Zeuglodon are
built, like an onion, of concentric layers, and these have a great
tendency to peel off during the preparation of a specimen. And now, as the wheels of time and change rolled slowly on, sharks
again came uppermost, and the warmer Eocene and Miocene oceans appear to
have fairly teemed with these sea wolves. There were small sharks with
slender teeth for catching little fishes, there were larger sharks with
saw-like teeth for cutting slices out of larger fishes, and there were
sharks that
might almost have swallowed the biggest fish of to-day whole, sharks of
a size the waters had never before contained, and fortunately do not
contain now. We know these monsters mostly by their teeth, for their
skeletons were cartilaginous, and this absence of their remains is
probably the reason why these creatures are passed by while the
adjectives huge, immense, enormous are lavished on the Mosasaurs and
Plesiosaurs–animals that the great-toothed shark, Carcharodon
megalodon, might well have eaten at a meal. For the gaping jaws of
one of these sharks, with its hundreds of gleaming teeth must, at a
moderate estimate, have measured not less than six feet across. The great White Shark, the man-eater, so often found in story books,
so rarely met with in real life, attains a length of thirty feet, and a
man just makes him a good, satisfactory lunch. Now a tooth of this shark
is an inch and a quarter long, while a tooth of the huge
Megalodon is commonly three, often four, and not infrequently
five inches long. Applying the rule of three to such a tooth as this
would give a shark 120 feet long, bigger than most
whales, to whom a man would be but a mouthful, just enough to whet his
sharkship's appetite. Even granting that the rule of three unduly
magnifies the dimensions of the brute, and making an ample reduction,
there would still remain a fish between seventy-five and one hundred
feet long, quite large enough to satisfy the most ambitious of
tuna fishers, and to have made bathing in the Miocene ocean
unpopular. Contemporary with the great-toothed shark was another and
closely related species that originated with him in Eocene times, and
these two may possibly have had something to do with the extinction of
Zeuglodon. This species is distinguished by having on either side of the
base of the great triangular cutting teeth a little projection or cusp,
like the "ear" on a jar, so that this species has been named
auriculatus, or eared. The edges of the teeth are also more
saw-like than in those of its greater relative, and as the species must
have attained a length of fifty or sixty feet it may, with its better
armature, have been quite as formidable. And, as perhaps the readers of
these pages may know, the
supply of teeth never ran short. Back of each tooth, one behind another
arranged in serried ranks, lay a reserve of six or seven smaller, but
growing teeth, and whenever a tooth of the front row was lost, the tooth
immediately behind it took its place, and like a well-trained soldier
kept the front line unbroken. Thus the teeth of sharks are continually
developing at the back, and all the teeth are steadily pushing forward,
a very simple mechanical arrangement causing the teeth to lie flat until
they reach the front of the jaw and come into use. Once fairly started in life, these huge sharks spread themselves
throughout the warm seas of the world, for there was none might stand
before them and say nay. They swarmed along our southern coast, from
Maryland to Texas; they swarmed everywhere that the water was
sufficiently warm, for their teeth occur in Tertiary strata in many
parts of the world, and the deep-sea dredges of the Challenger and
Albatross have brought up their teeth by scores. And then–they perished,
perished as utterly as did the hosts of Sennacherib. Why?
