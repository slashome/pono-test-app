Faujas St. Fond, as rendered into English, in Mantell's "Petrifactions
and their Teachings": "Some workmen, in blasting the rock in one
of the caverns of the interior of the mountain, perceived, to their
astonishment, the jaws of a large animal attached to the roof of the
chasm. The discovery was immediately made known to M. Hoffman, who
repaired to the spot, and for weeks presided over the arduous task of
separating the mass of stone containing these remains from the
surrounding rock. His labors were rewarded by the successful extrication
of the specimen, which he conveyed in triumph to his house. This
extraordinary discovery, however, soon became the subject of general
conversation, and excited so much interest that the canon of the
cathedral which stands on the mountain resolved to claim the fossil, in
right of being lord of the manor, and succeeded, after a long and
harassing lawsuit, in obtaining the precious relic. It remained for
years in his possession, and Hoffman died without regaining his
treasure. At length the French Revolution broke out, and the armies of
the Republic advanced to the gates of Maestricht. The town was
bombarded; but, at the suggestion of the committee of savans who
accompanied the French
troops to select their share of the plunder, the artillery was not
suffered to play on that part of the city in which the celebrated fossil
was known to be preserved. In the meantime, the canon of St. Peter's,
shrewdly suspecting the reason why such peculiar favor was shown to his
residence, removed the specimen and concealed it in a vault; but, when
the city was taken, the French authorities compelled him to give up his
ill-gotten prize, which was immediately transmitted to the Jardin des
Plantes, at Paris, where it still forms one of the most interesting
objects in that magnificent collection." And there it remains to this
day. Fig. 9.–A Great Sea Lizard,

The seas that rolled over western Kansas were the headquarters of the
Mosasaurs, and hundreds–aye, thousands–of specimens have been taken from
the chalk bluffs of that region, some of them in such a fine state of
preservation that we are not only well acquainted with their internal
structure, but with their outward appearance as well. They were
essentially swimming lizards–great, overgrown, and distant relatives of
the Monitors  of
Africa and Asia, especially adapted to a roving, predatory life by their
powerful tails and paddle-shaped feet. Their cup-and-ball vertebrÃ¦
indicate great flexibility of the body, their sharp teeth denote ability
to capture slippery prey, and the structure of the lower jaw shows that
they probably ate in a hurry and swallowed their food entire, or bolted
it in great chunks. The jaws of all reptiles are made up of a number of
pieces, but these are usually so spliced together that each half of the
jaw is one inflexible, or nearly inflexible, mass of bone. In snakes,
which swallow their prey entire, the difficulty of swallowing animals
greater in diameter than themselves is surmounted by having the two
halves of the lower jaw loosely joined at the free ends, so that these
may spread wide apart and thus increase the gape of the mouth. This is
also helped by the manner in which the jaw is joined to the head. The
pelican solves the problem by the length of his mandibles, this allowing
so much spring that when open they bow apart to form a nice little
landing net. In the Mosasaurs, as in the cormorants, among birds, there
 is a
sort of joint in each half of the lower jaw which permits it to bow
outward when opened, and this, aided by the articulation of the jaw with
the cranium, adds greatly to the swallowing capacity. Thus in nature the
same end is attained by very different methods. To borrow a suggestion
from Professor Cope, if the reader will extend his arms at full length,
the palms touching, and then bend his elbows outward he will get a very
good idea of the action of a Mosasaur's jaw. The western sea was a
lively place in the day of the great Mosasaurs, for with them swam the
king of turtles, Archelon, as Mr. Wieland has fitly named him, a
creature a dozen feet or more in length, with a head a full yard long,
while in the shallows prowled great fishes with massive jaws and teeth
like spikes. Fig. 10.–Jaw of a Mosasaur, Showing the Joint that Increased the
Swallowing Capacity of that Reptile. There, too, was the great, toothed diver,
Hesperornis (see page 83), while over the waters flew pterodactyls, with
a spread of wing of twenty feet, largest of all flying creatures; and,
not improbably–nay, very probably–fish-eaters, too; and when each and
all of these were seeking their dinners, there were troublous times for
the small fry in that old Kansan sea. And then there came a change; to the south, to the west, to the
north, the land was imperceptibly but surely rising, perhaps only an
inch or two in a century, but still rising, until "The Ocean in which
flourished this abundant and vigorous life was at last completely
inclosed on the west by elevations of sea-bottom, so that it only
communicated with the Atlantic and Pacific at the Gulf of Mexico and the
Arctic Sea."

The continued elevation of both eastern and western shores contracted
its area, and when ridges of the sea-bottom reached the surface, forming
long, low bars, parts of the water-area were included, and connection
with salt-water prevented. Thus were the living beings imprisoned and
subjected to many new risks to life. The stronger could more readily capture the weaker, while the fishes
would gradually perish through the constant freshening of the water. With the death of any considerable class, the balance of food-supply
would be lost, and many large species would disappear from the scene. The most omnivorous and enduring would longest resist the approach of
starvation, but would finally yield to inexorable fate–the last one
caught by the shifting bottom among shallow pools, from which his
exhausted energies could not extricate him.[5]
