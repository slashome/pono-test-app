It is this inter-dependence of living things that makes the outcome
of any direct interference with the natural order of things more or less
problematical, and sometimes brings about results quite different from
what were expected or intended. The gamekeepers on the grouse moors of Scotland systematically killed
off all birds of prey because they caught some of the grouse, but this
is believed to have caused far more harm than good through permitting
weak and sickly birds, that would otherwise have fallen a prey to hawks,
to live and disseminate the grouse distemper. The destruction of sheep by coyotes led the State of California to
place a bounty on the heads of these animals, with the result that
in
eighteen months the State was called upon to pay out $187,485. As a
result of the war on coyotes the animals on which they fed, notably the
rabbits, increased so enormously that in turn a bounty was put on
rabbits, the damage these animals caused the fruit-growers being greater
than the losses among sheep-owners from the depredations of coyotes. And
so, says Dr. Palmer, "In this remarkable case of legislation a large
bounty was offered by a county in the interest of fruit-growers to
counteract the effects of a State bounty expended mainly for the benefit
of sheep-owners!"

Professor Shaler, in noting the sudden disappearance of such trees as
the gums, magnolias, and tulip poplars from the Miocene flora of Europe
has suggested that this may have been due to the attacks, for a series
of years, of some insect enemy like the gipsy moth, and the theory is
worth considering, although it must be looked upon as a possibility
rather than a probability. Still, anyone familiar with the ravages of
the gipsy moth in Massachusetts, where the insect was introduced by
accident, can readily imagine what might have been
the effect of some sudden increase in the numbers of such a pest on the
forests of the past. Trees might resist the attacks of enemies and the
destruction of their leaves for two or three years, but would be
destroyed by a few additional seasons of defoliation. Ordinarily the abnormal increase of any insect is promptly followed
by an increase in the number of its enemies; the pest is killed off, the
destroyers die of starvation and nature's balance is struck. But if by
some accident, such as two or three consecutive seasons of wet, drought,
or cold, the natural increase of the enemies was checked, the balance of
nature would be temporarily destroyed and serious harm done. That such
accidents may occur is familiar to us by the damage wrought in Florida
and other Southern States by the unwonted severity of the winters of
1893, 1895, and 1899. If any group of forest trees was destroyed in the manner suggested by
Professor Shaler, the effects would be felt by various plants and
animals. In the first place, the insects that fed on these trees would
be forced to seek another
source of food and would be brought into a silent struggle with forms
already in possession, while the destruction of one set of plants would
be to the advantage of those with which they came into competition and
to the disadvantage of vegetation that was protected by the shade. Finally, these changed conditions would react in various ways on the
smaller birds and mammals, the general effect being, to use a well-worn
simile, like that of casting a stone into a quiet pool and setting in
motion ripples that sooner or later reach to every part of the
margin. It is scarcely necessary to warn the reader that for the most part
this is purely conjectural, for from the nature of the case it is bound
to be so. But it is one of the characteristics of educated man that he
wishes to know the why and wherefore of everything, and is in a
condition of mental unhappiness until he has at least formulated some
theory which seems to harmonize with the visible facts. And from the few
glimpses we get of the extinction of animals from natural causes we must
formulate a theory to fit the continued extermination that
has been taking place ever since living beings came into the world and
were pitted against one another and against their surroundings in the
silent and ceaseless struggle for existence. THE END. INDEX
